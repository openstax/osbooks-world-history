    <para id="para-00002">Many elements of early Roman culture and society resulted from Greek influence on the Italian peninsula. Later, when the Roman state expanded and built an empire, its people transmitted their culture—heavily indebted to Ancient Greece—to the Celtic and Germanic tribes of central and western Europe. They also transmitted their language, which is why French, Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish are known as “Romance” languages: They are descended from the Latin language spoken by the Romans. The classical civilizations of Ancient Greece and Rome were therefore the foundation for what became known as Western civilization.</para>

    <title>The Foundation and Function of the Roman Republic</title>
    <para id="para-00003">During the Archaic period, Greeks established colonies on Sicily and in southern Italy that went on to influence the culture of Italy. By around 500 BCE, the inhabitants of central Italy, who spoke Latin, had adopted much of Greek culture as their own, including the idea that citizens should have a voice in the governance of the state. For example, the people of the small city-state of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Rome</term> referred to their state as <emphasis effect="italics">res publica,</emphasis> meaning “public thing” (to distinguish it from the <emphasis effect="italics">res privata</emphasis>, or “private thing,” that had characterized oligarchical and monarchical rule under the Etruscans). <emphasis effect="italics">Res publica</emphasis>—from which the word “<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">republic</term>” derives—signified that government happens in the open, for everyone to see. Early Romans also adopted Greek gods and myths as well as other elements of Greek culture.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">The Romans passed down many traditions about the early history of their republic, recorded by historians such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Livy</term> in the first century BCE. These stories often reflected the values that the Romans revered. According to Roman tradition, the city was founded in 753 BCE by the twin brothers <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Romulus</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Remus</term>, sons of Mars, the god of war (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). It was said that Romulus killed his brother when Remus mocked his construction of a wall around the new city and jumped over it. This story brought into focus for Romans their respect for boundaries and private property.</para>

    <para id="para-00005">Romulus assembled a group of criminals and debtors to inhabit his city, and, to secure wives for them, he invited the neighboring <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Sabines</term> to attend a festival with their unmarried daughters and sisters. The Romans seized the women, and when the Sabines returned with an army to recover them, the women, now Roman wives, said they had been treated with respect and wished to remain. The Sabines and the Romans then joined together in a single city-state. This story showed that a person did not have to be born a Roman to receive the rights of citizenship. It also reflected women’s social status in Rome, which was higher than their status in other ancient cultures. They couldn’t vote or hold public office, but they could own property and freely participate in public events such as banquets.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">These stories also include details of Roman ideas about government. For example, they note that in its early centuries, Rome was a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">monarchy</term>, with the first king being Romulus. After the passing of the fourth king, the throne was assumed by Lucius <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Tarquinius Priscus</term>, an Etruscan. The next two kings were also Etruscan. The last of these, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Tarquin the Proud</term>, was the final king of Rome, whose son raped a young Roman woman named Lucretia. This act triggered a rebellion against the monarchy, which ultimately ousted the Etruscan king. In 509 BCE, the victorious Romans declared their government to be a republic and vowed never to be subject to tyranny again. This story emphasized the Roman respect for the rule of law. No one, no matter how powerful, was above it.</para>

    <title><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Lucretia</term>’s Sacrifice for Rome</title>
    <para id="para-00007">Like many stories about Rome’s early history, the story of the rape of Lucretia emphasizes Roman values, in this case, virtue. Revered as a model Roman woman, Lucretia embodied sexual purity and loyalty to her husband at the expense of her safety, her autonomy, and even her life. According to the story, Sextus Tarquinius, the son of the king, is staying at Collatinus and Lucretia's home. During the night, Tarquinius enters Lucretia's chambers with his sword in hand, He threatens her with successive acts of violence and disgrace before raping her. While recounting the events, Lucretia asks her family to pledge that they will avenge her, and then she dies by suicide. Scholars debate the reason for her suicide, with some indicating it was related to shame, others viewing it as Lucretia asserting control, while still others see it as an allegory for the death of the Roman monarchy.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">The historian Livy’s account of Lucretia’s suicide, written in the first century BCE, shows the story’s enduring value in Roman culture. It begins as Lucretia’s husband and father run to her aid after hearing she has been raped by Sextus Tarquinius, son of the king. Lucretia they found sitting sadly in her chamber.</para>
    <quote id="quote-00001"><para id="para-00009">The entrance of her friends brought the tears to her eyes, and to her husband’s question, “Is all well?” She replied, “Far from it; for what can be well with a woman when she has lost her honor? The print of a strange man, Collatinus [her husband], is in your bed. Yet my body only has been violated; my heart is guiltless, as death shall be my witness. But pledge your right hands and your words that the adulterer shall not go unpunished. Sextus Tarquinius is he that last night returned hostility for hospitality, and armed with force brought ruin on me, and on himself no less—if you are men—when he worked his pleasure with me.” They give their pledges, every man in turn. They seek to comfort her, sick at heart as she is, by diverting the blame from her who was forced to the doer of the wrong. They tell her it is the mind that sins, not the body; and that where purpose has been wanting there is no guilt. “It is for you to determine,” she answers, “what is due to him; for my own part, though I acquit myself of the sin, I do not absolve myself from punishment; not in time to come shall ever unchaste woman live through the example of Lucretia.” Taking a knife that she had concealed beneath her dress, she plunged it into her heart, and sinking forward upon the wound, died as she fell. The wail for the dead was raised by her husband and her father.</para>

    <para id="para-00011">Archaeological evidence seems to indicate at least some historical basis for these accounts of Rome's founding. In 1988, a wall was discovered around the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Palatine Hill</term> where Romulus reportedly built his fortification. Archaeologists also found Greek pottery from this period at the same location, suggesting trade took place. The city of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Rome</term> is located along the Tiber River where it was no longer navigable to sea-going vessels. Greek merchants would have sailed up the Tiber from the Mediterranean Sea and traded with the native peoples there. Greek merchants and colonists arriving in Italy at this time influenced the Iron Age culture in northern and central Italy, which then evolved though Greek influence into the Latin and Etruscan cultures. Around 600 BCE, the Etruscans colonized Rome, which became an Etruscan city-state. The story of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Tarquin dynasty</term> reflects this Etruscan period of Roman history. Modern historians maintain that the story of the expulsion of the Tarquins is loosely based on historical events, which saw the Roman <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">city-state</term> free itself from Etruscan domination and establish an independent republic around 500 BCE.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">In the early republic, Rome was ruled by elected magistrates instead of kings, and by a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Council of Elders</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Senate</term>. Roman society was divided into two classes or orders, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">patricians</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">plebeians</term>. The patricians were the aristocratic elite, who alone could hold public office and sit in the Senate. From the beginning of the republic through the third century BCE, the plebeians, or common people, worked to achieve equality before the law in Roman society. The political conflict between these two classes is known as the <term id="term-00022">Struggle of the Orders</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">Rome was located on a coastal plain known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Latium</term>. East of it were the foothills of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Apennine Mountains</term>, inhabited by warlike tribes that made periodic raids. When Rome was under threat, the plebeians could gain leverage with the patricians by refusing to fight until their demands were met. In 450 BCE, the plebeians went on strike for the first time. They feared that patrician judges were interpreting Rome’s unwritten laws to take advantage of ignorant plebeians, so they demanded the laws be written down. The patricians agreed. In the <term id="term-00025">Twelve Tables</term>, published in the Forum, Rome’s laws were written for the first time and were then accessible to all citizens.</para>
    <note class="link-to-learning" id="note-00002">
    <para id="para-00014">Read excerpts from Rome’s <link url="https://openstax.org/l/77TwelveTables">Twelve Tables of law</link> from Fordham University’s Ancient History Sourcebook. What do these laws tell us about Roman society in 450 BCE, when they were first written down?</para>
    </note>
    <para id="para-00015">After 450 BCE, the plebeians met in a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">Plebeian Assembly</term> that annually elected ten officials known as tribunes. These tribunes attended meetings of Rome’s assemblies, the Senate, and the law courts. If they saw any public body or official taking action that would bring harm to plebeians, they could say “<emphasis effect="italics">Veto</emphasis>” or “I forbid” and stop that action. This power to veto gave plebeians a way to protect themselves and put a check on the power of patrician officials.</para>
    <para id="para-00016">In the fourth and third centuries BCE, plebeians won more concessions by again seceding from the patrician state. After 367 BCE, one of the two consuls, the highest officials in the republic, had to be a plebeian. After 287 BCE, the Plebeian Assembly could pass laws for the republic that were introduced to it by the tribunes, and their laws applied to all Roman citizens. By the third century BCE, the Struggle of the Orders had effectively concluded, since it was now possible for plebeians to pass laws, serve as elected officials, and sit in the Senate, equals of the patricians under Roman law. The Struggle of the Orders did not bring equality to everyone in Rome, however. Rather, it gave well-off plebeians access to positions of power.</para>
    <para id="para-00017">Romans were a very conservative people who greatly venerated the <emphasis effect="italics">mos maiorum</emphasis> or “way of the ancestors.” Their political system was a combination of written laws and political traditions and customs that had evolved since the birth of the Republic. By the third century BCE, this system was being administrated by a combination of public assemblies, elected officials, and the Senate.</para>
    <para id="para-00018">The Roman Republic had three main public assemblies—the Plebeian Assembly, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Tribal Assembly</term>, and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Centuriate Assembly</term>—that elected various officials every year. Only plebeians could attend the Plebeian Assembly, organized into thirty-five regional tribes with a single vote each. It was this assembly that annually elected the ten tribunes, who possessed veto power and could present laws to the assembly for approval. The Tribal Assembly was likewise divided into thirty-five tribes based on place of residence, with each tribe casting one vote, but both plebeians and patricians could attend. Every year, the Tribal Assembly elected the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Quaestors</term>, treasurers in charge of public money.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">Only the Centuriate Assembly could declare war, though the Senate remained in control of foreign policy. Both plebeians and patricians could attend this assembly, which was organized into blocs. The number of votes assigned to each bloc was based on the number of centuries—meaning a group of one hundred men in a military unit—that bloc could afford to equip with weapons and armor. Wealthier citizens had more votes because they could pay more to support the military. This assembly also elected military commanders, judges, and the censor, whose main task was to conduct the census to assess the wealth of Rome’s citizens.</para>
    <para id="para-00020">All elected officials joined the Roman Senate as members for life after their term in office. By far the most powerful institution in the Roman state, the Senate decided how public money was to be spent and advised elected officials on their course of action. Elected officials rarely ignored the Senate’s advice since many of them would be senators themselves after leaving office.</para>
    <para id="para-00021">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">patron-client system</term> was another important element in the Roman political system. A patron was usually a wealthy citizen who provided legal and financial assistance to his clients, who were normally less affluent citizens. In return, clients in the Roman assemblies voted as directed by their patrons. Patrons could inherit clients, and those with many wielded great influence in Rome.</para>

    <title>The Expansion of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Roman Republic</term></title>
    <para id="para-00022">The early Romans did not plan on building an immense empire. They were surrounded by hostile city-states and tribes, and in the process of defeating them they made new enemies even as they expanded their network of allies. Thus they were constantly sending armies farther afield to crush these threats until Rome emerged in the second century BCE as the most powerful state in all the lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea.</para>
    <para id="para-00023">The Roman Senate developed certain policies in conducting wars that proved quite successful (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>). One was to divide and conquer. The Romans always tried to defeat one enemy at a time and avoid waging war against a coalition. Thus they often attempted to turn their enemies against each other. Another tactic was to negotiate from strength. Even after suffering enormous defeats in battle, Rome would continue a war until it won a major engagement and reach a position from which to negotiate for peace with momentum on its side. Yet another successful strategy was to establish colonies in recently conquered lands to serve as the first line of defense if a region revolted against Rome. Well-constructed roads were also built to link Rome to these colonies, so armies could arrive quickly in a region that rebelled. Thanks to these networks across Italy, the language and culture of Rome eventually spread throughout its empire as well. Romans also transformed former enemies into loyal allies who could enjoy self-government as long as they honored Rome’s other alliances and provided troops in times of war. Some even received Roman citizenship.</para>

    <title>The Roman Conquest of the Mediterranean</title>
    <para id="para-00024">After conquering most of the Italian peninsula, Rome came to challenge the other major power in the region, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">Carthage</term>. A series of wars ensued, called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Punic Wars</term>, in which Rome and Carthage vied for dominance. During the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">First Punic War</term> (264–241 BCE), Rome and Carthage battled for control of the island of Sicily. Although Carthage had the largest fleet at the time, the Romans won by dropping a hooked plank on the deck of an opposing ship and using it as a causeway to cross over, transforming a sea battle in which they were at a disadvantage into a land battle where they could dominate. After the destruction of its fleet, Carthage sued for peace, and the war ended with Rome annexing Sicily.</para>
    <para id="para-00025">Carthage desired revenge.

Hannibal hoped Rome’s allies would abandon it and leave the city at his mercy.

    <title>A Republic of Troubles</title>
    <para id="para-00030">Rome’s constant wars and conquests in the third and second centuries BCE created a host of social, economic, and political problems for the republic. The Roman people grew dissatisfied with the leadership of the Senate and the aristocratic elite, and they increasingly looked to strong military leaders to address the problems.</para>
    <para id="para-00031">A number of factors contributed to these problems and transformations. From the foundation of the republic, most Roman citizens had owned and operated small family farms. Indeed, to serve as Roman soldiers, men had to own property. However, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">Punic Wars</term> had strained this traditional system. Roman soldiers were often away from home for long periods of time, leaving the women and children to maintain their holdings. When they ultimately did return, many found their property in another’s hands. Others decided to sell their neglected farms and move their families to the expanding city of Rome, where they joined the growing ranks of the landless working class known as the <term id="term-00054">proletariat</term>. By the first century BCE, the population of the city of Rome may have exceeded one million.</para>
    <para id="para-00032">The growth of the proletariat disrupted the Roman political system and invited large-scale corruption. The traditional <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">patron-client system</term> collapsed, since landless Romans didn’t need the assistance of patrons to settle property disputes. Politicians therefore had to win the support of the urban masses with free food and entertainment, such as gladiatorial combats, and promises to create jobs through public works projects. Some even organized the poor into violent gangs to frighten their political rivals. These conditions resulted in widespread dissatisfaction with the government of the republic.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">To meet the growing demand for grain, wine, and olive oil to feed the urban population, large landowners bought land from poor Roman farmers and leased public land from the Roman state to create large plantations. These were very profitable because landowners could cheaply purchase enslaved people, who were plentiful. For example, after the defeat of Perseus of Macedon in 168 BCE, the Romans enslaved 150,000 people from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">Epirus</term> as punishment since this kingdom had been allied with Perseus in the war. Pirates from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">Cilicia</term> (in southeast Turkey) and from the Greek island of Crete also kidnapped people throughout the eastern Mediterranean and sold them to Roman traders. The island of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">Delos</term> in the Aegean Sea became a massive human market in the second century BCE, where reportedly ten thousand people were bought and sold every day.</para>
    <para id="para-00034">Terrible working conditions resulted in massive revolts by the enslaved, beginning in the second half of the second century BCE. The most famous was led by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">Spartacus</term>, an enslaved man and gladiator from Thrace (modern Bulgaria). In 76 BCE, Spartacus and other enslaved gladiators rose against their owners and were quickly joined by hundreds of thousands of others (<link target-id="fig-00007"/>). Spartacus’s forces defeated two Roman armies before being crushed in 71 BCE. The Romans crucified thousands of the rebels along Italy’s major roads to send a warning to enslaved people across Italy.</para>

    <para id="para-00035">In addition to the proletariat and enslaved people, new classes of wealthy Romans were also unhappy with the leadership of the traditional elite. The most profitable enterprise for these new Roman entrepreneurs was acting as bankers and public contractors, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">publicans</term>. The republic relied on publicans to construct public works such as aqueducts and theaters, as well as to operate government-owned mines and collect taxes. Roman governors often looked the other way when publicans squeezed additional tax revenues from the populations of the provinces.</para>
    <para id="para-00036">This tumultuous and complicated environment led to the rise of two of the Late Republic’s most intriguing political figures, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061">Gracchi</term>, as they are collectively known, were plebeian brothers whose families had been members of the elite for generations (Scipio Africanus was their grandfather). Tiberius, the elder brother, was concerned to see the large plantations being worked by enslaved foreigners rather than Roman farmers. He feared Rome’s military was in danger since Rome relied on its land-owning farmers to equip themselves and serve in the army. In 133 BCE, as a tribune, he proposed a law to distribute public land to landless Romans. This measure struck a blow at the senatorial class, many of whom had accumulated huge swaths of land formerly owned by independent farmers who had gone to war. The assembly voted to approve the proposal, but many senators were horrified not only because they stood to lose land but also because, to win the vote, Tiberius had violated the traditions of the Republic. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00062">Republic</term> was ruled by the upper classes, and in courting popular opinion, the brothers had challenged elite control over high political institutions. Convinced he was assuming too much popular support and violating the traditions of Rome, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00063">Senate</term> declared a state of emergency and a group of senators beat Tiberius to death.</para>
    <para id="para-00037">Ten years later Tiberius’s brother Gaius, an astute politician as well, was also elected tribune. He won over poor Roman farmers with his proposal to establish new colonies to give them land. He also provided free grain for the poor and called for new public works projects to create jobs for the working class and lucrative contracts for wealthy publicans. His measures passed the Plebeian Assembly. Gaius was also elected tribune for two years straight, in violation of Roman political tradition. The final straw for the Senate was Gaius’s proposal to establish a new court system that could try senators for corruption. In 121 BCE, the senators took action to subdue Gaius. He attempted to use force himself to resist the Senate, but in the end his supporters were massacred and he died, either by his own hand or at the hands of senators who had opposed his rise to power.</para>

    <title>The Rise of Client Armies</title>
    <para id="para-00038">After the assassination of Gaius Gracchus, Rome’s political class was divided into two warring factions. The <term id="term-00064"><emphasis effect="italics">populares</emphasis></term> were politicians who, like Gaius, sought the political support of discontented groups in Roman society, whereas the <term id="term-00065"><emphasis effect="italics">optimates</emphasis></term> were the champions of the old order and the traditional leadership of the elite in the Roman Senate. In 112 BCE, Rome went to war against <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00066">Jugurtha</term>, the king of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067">Numidia</term> (modern Algeria/Tunisia) in North Africa, after he slaughtered Romans there who had supported his brother as king. Roman armies suffered defeat after defeat, and due to the decline in numbers of Roman farmers, Rome was having difficulty filling the ranks.</para>
    <para id="para-00039">Gaius <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00068">Marius</term> was a plebeian and commoner who rose up the ranks of the Roman army and emerged as the leader of the <emphasis effect="italics">populares</emphasis>. In 107 BCE, he ran for consul by denouncing the traditional Roman elites as weak and ineffective generals and promising to quickly end the war with Jugurtha. Such rhetoric was wildly popular with the common people who supported him. Once in power, Marius reformed the entrance requirements for the army to open it to proletariats, extending them the opportunity for war gains and even land for their service. These reforms led to the emergence of professional client armies, or armies composed of men more loyal to their commander than to the state.</para>
    <para id="para-00040">By 105 BCE, Jugurtha was captured and then paraded through the Roman streets in chains. That same year, Rome faced new threats from the north in the form of Germanic tribes crossing the Rhine River and seeking to invade Italy. The Romans elected Marius consul for five consecutive terms (105–101 BCE) to lead his professional army against these enemies. After his victories, however, his enemies in the Senate wanted to embarrass him politically, so they prevented his proposal to give veterans land from becoming law. Marius was intimidated by these events and retired from politics.</para>
    <para id="para-00041">In 90 BCE, Rome was again in turmoil when its Italian allies revolted after years of providing troops without having any voice in governing. During this “Social” War (90–88 BCE), the Romans under the leadership of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00069">Sulla</term>, an <emphasis effect="italics">optimate</emphasis>, defeated the rebels. Shortly thereafter, in 88 BCE, Rome’s provinces in Greece and Asia Minor also revolted, after years of heavy taxes and corrupt governors. The rebels massacred thousands of Roman citizens and rallied around <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00070">Mithridates</term>, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00071">Hellenistic</term> king of Pontus in north Asia Minor. <emphasis effect="italics">Optimates</emphasis> in the Senate appointed <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00072">Sulla</term> to lead an army against Mithridates. Like Marius, Sulla had promised his recruits land in return for their service. <emphasis effect="italics">Populares</emphasis> in the Plebeian Assembly, however, assigned command of the army to Marius, who had come out of retirement.</para>
    <para id="para-00042">Sulla, then outside Rome with his client army, convinced his soldiers to choose personal loyalty to their general and his promise of land over their allegiance to Rome, and they marched on the city. Sulla’s army hunted down and murdered many <emphasis effect="italics">populares</emphasis>, and after establishing his own faction in charge of Rome, Sulla marched against Mithridates (<link target-id="fig-00008"/>).</para>

    <para id="para-00043">In 87 BCE, Marius, who had been in hiding, rallied his old veterans and marched on Rome, marking the second time in two years that Roman soldiers had chosen personal loyalty to their general over obedience to Rome’s laws. Marius’s men now hunted down and murdered <emphasis effect="italics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00073">optimates</term></emphasis>. After winning his seventh term as consul in 87 BCE, Marius died in office from natural causes. Having forced Mithridates out of Greece and restored Roman rule there, Sulla led his army back to Rome in 83 BCE to overthrow the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00074"><emphasis effect="italics">populares</emphasis></term> who were still in charge. While in Rome, he compelled the Senate to appoint him <term id="term-00075">dictator</term>. The office of dictator was an ancient republican office used only during emergencies because it granted absolute authority for a limited time to handle the emergency. When Sulla assumed the office, it hadn’t been used since the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00076">Second Punic War</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00044">During Sulla’s time as dictator, he ordered the execution of his political enemies and reformed the laws. In 79 BCE, he relinquished the office and retired from public life, convinced he had saved the republic and preserved the power of the traditional elite in the Senate. Instead, however, within half a century the Roman Republic was dead.</para>

    <para id="para-00045">The Romans overthrew the Etruscan dynasty at the close of the sixth century BCE and became a republic. The Struggle of the Orders ended with the plebeians winning equality with the patricians under the law, and by the third century BCE Roman citizens were electing officials and passing legislation through various assemblies under the watchful eye of the Senate. By the third century BCE, Rome had united the Italian peninsula by pledging to defend all new allies from their enemies. With these allies, Rome possessed the military resources to crush the other Mediterranean powers, Carthage and the Hellenistic monarchies of the eastern Mediterranean.</para>
    <para id="para-00046">By the mid-second century BCE, Rome was the dominant power in the Mediterranean. But the wars had created a number of social problems tearing the Republic apart. These conflicts led to the rise of the Gracchi and later the partisan battle between the <emphasis effect="italics">populares</emphasis> who opposed the governing elite and the <emphasis effect="italics">optimates</emphasis> who supported it. By the end of the second century BCE, powerful military commanders and their client armies had assumed great authority in the republic. One of these commanders, General Sulla, twice marched on Rome to secure power for his political faction, the <emphasis effect="italics">optimates</emphasis>. In 79 BCE, he retired, but his marches on Rome and his resurrection of the office of dictator laid the groundwork for the permanent overthrow of the Republic later.</para>
