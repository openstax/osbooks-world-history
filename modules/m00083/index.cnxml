    <para id="para-00002">On February 24, 2022, the world watched in horror and frustration as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Russia</term>n tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border and began bombing cities around the former Soviet republic. This was the second time in fewer than ten years that Russian troops had invaded the nation. In 2014, Russian forces had annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. While both invasions were decades in the making, to many they seemed like a rerun of a bygone era. Those who had watched Soviet tanks roll into Budapest and Prague to quell uprisings in the 1950s and 1960s saw the invasion of 2014 and the violence of 2022 as a reminder that some problems, no matter how far in the past, remain unresolved.</para>

    <title>Instability in the Post–Cold War World</title>
    <para id="para-00003">When the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Soviet Union</term> dissolved on December 31, 1991, most in the West celebrated the end of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Cold War</term>, believing that a new world that would uniformly embrace liberal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">democracy</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">capitalism</term> was in the process of being born. Political scientist Francis <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Fukuyama</term> even published a book on the idea in 1992 called <emphasis effect="italics">The End of History and the Last Man</emphasis>. The argument presented in the book was that the world had been marching toward a Western liberal democratic future for centuries, and with the Soviet Union gone, it had reached the inevitable end of its “ideological evolution.” With the United States as the only remaining superpower, many also assumed the Cold War’s bipolar world would soon evolve into a mostly unipolar one based on U.S. military, cultural, and economic dominance.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">With this idea in mind, U.S. president Bill <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Clinton</term> drafted a foreign policy platform geared to revising and expanding the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">NATO</term>), the alliance for mutual defense forged by the United States and other Western democracies during the Cold War. Clinton aimed to strengthen relationships in Asia, bring post–Soviet Russia into the international community, and address ethnic and political strife in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Middle East</term>, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Balkans</term>, No<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">rthern Ireland</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Latin America</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">East Africa</term>. These goals occasionally required using the country’s military, such as in 1995 when Clinton sent a force of twenty thousand to the Balkans as part of a NATO operation to enforce a cease-fire and protect upcoming elections.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">One of the most pressing concerns for the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">United States</term> and the world, however, was the need to secure the thirty-five thousand <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">nuclear weapons</term> then installed in thousands of sites around Eurasia. Many were in states that had separated from the former Soviet Union such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Ukraine</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Kazakhstan</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Belarus</term>. Because these countries were going through a difficult period of transition and instability, many feared that non-state actors, meaning <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">terrorist group</term>s not tied to a specific country, might gain access to the armaments or the material necessary to make them and cause catastrophic damage. Some of the work had begun even before the Soviet Union collapsed. In the summer of 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union had signed the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">START</term>), agreeing to each reduce their arms stockpiles by more than 80 percent.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">After the disintegration of the USSR, however, the need to secure these stockpiles became more pressing. The solution proposed by the United States and supported by Russia was to denuclearize those states that had split from the former Soviet Union but still possessed nuclear weapons. While successful, the effort did run into some difficulties, particularly in Ukraine, which felt that preserving its nuclear weapons would be the best way to deter Russian belligerence in the future. Only after it had secured assurances from the international community that its borders would be respected did Ukraine allow its nuclear weapons to be removed and disassembled in Russia.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">Nuclear proliferation elsewhere around the world was also a problem. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">India</term>, for example, had become a nuclear power in 1974. At the time, it claimed it was not pursuing nuclear weapons capability, but since then, it has embraced these weapons as an important part of its security platform. Given the history of hostility between India and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Pakistan</term>, international observers in the 1970s worried about the implications of a nuclear-armed India. Some of these fears were realized in 1998 when Pakistan tested its first nuclear weapons, a goal toward which it had been building since before India became a nuclear power. While India maintains a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">no-first-use doctrine</term> for its nuclear weapons, Pakistan has not reciprocated. Today, the countries have approximately one hundred nuclear weapons each, as well as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">long-range ballistic missile delivery systems</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">Only a few years after Pakistan tested its first nuclear weapon, the illusion of an enduring post–Cold War peace was further shaken when on <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">September 11</term>, 2001, nineteen militant Islamic hijackers took control of four large passenger airplanes and crashed two of them into New York City’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">World Trade Center</term> (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>), one into the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Pentagon</term>, and the fourth—after its path was deflected by passengers—into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. It was soon determined that the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">terrorist attack</term>, which killed nearly three thousand people from many nations, had been orchestrated by <term id="term-00035">al-Qaeda</term>, an Islamic terrorist organization then based in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">Afghanistan</term> that was financed and led by a militant Saudi Arabian national named Osama <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">bin Laden</term>. According to bin Laden, the attack was carried out in response to U.S. support for Israel and its continued military presence in the Middle East.</para>

    <para id="para-00009">After assessing the damage and collecting global support, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">United States</term> launched an attack on Afghanistan with the stated purpose of finding those responsible. This offensive represented the beginning of the U.S. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">war on terror</term> and resulted in the collapse of Afghanistan’s Islamic fundamentalist <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">Taliban</term> government, many of whose officials fled to the southern parts of the country or into neighboring Pakistan. Most of al-Qaeda’s leadership also escaped, however, including Osama bin Laden. Over the next several years, the U.S. military pursued a policy of eliminating al-Qaeda, rebuilding civil society and infrastructure in Afghanistan, and propping up a democratically elected regime in the country. These efforts were made more difficult, however, by the decision of President George <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">W. Bush</term> to launch a war against Iraq in 2003.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">The United States supported <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">Iraq</term> during the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">Iran-Iraq War</term> (1980–1988) but came into conflict with it during the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">Gulf War</term> in 1990, when Iraq invaded its neighbor <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">Kuwait</term>. The United States, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">Great Britain</term>, and thirty-three other nations came to Kuwait’s defense by bombing Iraqi targets and then launching a ground invasion. A mere one hundred hours after the coalition’s ground invasion began, Iraqi forces had retreated from Kuwait, and a cease-fire was in place. Immediately following, uprisings took place in Kurdish and Shi‛ite regions of Iraq that sought to topple President Saddam Hussein’s government. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">Hussein</term> brutally crushed the attempted revolts, but the coalition forces withdrew from Iraq, leaving him in power.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">In 2001, in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. foreign policy leaders began to worry that Hussein might acquire <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">weapons of mass destruction</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">WMD</term>s), possibly including biological weapons. The Bush administration wanted to prevent this and to channel the international goodwill showered on the country after the 2001 attacks toward the goal of removing the Iraqi leader. To this end, the United States built a new coalition of Asian, European, and Latin American countries. It sent Secretary of State Colin <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">Powell</term> to the United Nations to present the argument that Iraq had connections to al-Qaeda and possessed WMDs that made it a threat to international security (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). Even though at the time some in the U.S. intelligence community felt the evidence on which Powell relied was weak or flawed, to secure support for a U.S. invasion, members of the Bush administration such as Vice President Dick <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">Cheney</term> claimed the WMDs existed.</para>

    <para id="para-00012">The invasion began on March 19, 2003, just a few weeks after Powell’s presentation. By 2005, it had become obvious to the world that Iraq did not possess WMDs, and the hypothetical al-Qaeda connection had not been demonstrated. The invasion contributed to the violent unraveling of Iraqi society, however, which the coalition forces then struggled for years to bring under control. There were countless civilian casualties; Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs estimates that between 184,382 and 207,156 civilians were killed. While the United States could point to some successes, such as the 2005 Iraq elections and the 2006 conviction of Saddam Hussein for crimes against humanity, the nation’s reputation as a global force capable of projecting power to bring about positive change in the world had suffered greatly.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">The consequences for the United States became more obvious in October 2006 when communist <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">North Korea</term> launched its first nuclear weapons test, an event the U.S. government had worked for years to prevent. The test was the culmination of decades of work inside the isolated country. North Korean leaders believed nuclear weapons would guarantee its survival in the post–Cold War world. But the United States and neighboring countries like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">South Korea</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">Japan</term> worried that the unstable North Korean regime might use the weapons against them. Given the problems in Iraq and diminished global standing of the United States, it was unclear whether North Korea could be deterred from attempting additional tests, or whether the United States could discourage Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapons program.</para>

    <title>Radicalism, Refugees, and Resistance</title>
    <para id="para-00014">In 2011, the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq was completed, eight long years after the invasion. Hopes that peace in Iraq would last were dashed, however, with the rise of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">ISIL</term>), a fundamentalist and militant Islamic group also referred to as the <term id="term-00057">Islamic State</term>. Formed in 1999, ISIL had fought against the U.S.-led coalition that invaded Iraq in 2003. In 2014, it attacked Iraqi security forces and drove them from a number of cities, including Ramadi, Fallujah, and Mosul, and it killed thousands of members of the Yazidi minority group in Iraq’s Sinjar district.</para>

This is a claim most of the world’s Muslims reject. In response, a military coalition led by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">United States</term> returned to Iraq following a request by the Iraqi government. Meanwhile, ISIL’s counterpart in Syria, known as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061">Islamic State of Iraq and Syria</term>, waged war against both the government of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00062">Syria</term> and other nonfundamentalist groups that were also seeking to oust Syria’s president Bashar <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00063">al-Assad</term>.

    <para id="para-00017">Upon arrival, these groups met various responses. While some argued that the refugees had survived trauma and deserved to be welcomed with open arms, others said they were fleeing circumstances outside the host country’s responsibility and would bring too many cultural and religious changes. For example, many Europeans feared that refugees from Islamic countries would reject the values of the largely secular European nations in which they settled. Many others believe that Muslims embrace political extremism or support acts of terrorism. Responding to the developing migrant crisis, German chancellor Angela <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00071">Merkel</term> declared, “We can do this!” and promised Germany would welcome 800,000 refugees in 2015.</para>

    <para id="para-00022">By supporting the coup with money, military training, and the sharing of intelligence reports, the United States hoped to return stability to El Salvador, but the opposite occurred. Many in El Salvador felt the military government was illegitimate and staged protests and resistance. The military responded with violence of its own, such as a deadly attack on demonstrators in 1980. There were also rightist paramilitary groups, often referred to as “<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00089">death squads</term>,” fighting against leftist guerrilla forces in the countryside and committing murders and massacres. As the country descended into chaos, many left and found refuge in the United States. Today these immigrants number about 2.5 million.</para>
    <para id="para-00023">A similar pattern of civil war and instability in other parts of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00090">Central America</term> has also produced <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00091">human rights abuses</term> and an increase in migration to the United States. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00092">Guatemalan Civil War</term> (1960–1996), for example, led to numerous human rights violations against Guatemalans. These included a reported campaign of violence and terrorism by the government against ethnic <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00093">Mayans</term> and peasants accused of supporting leftist guerrilla groups. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00094">Nicaragua</term> has experienced destabilization since the 1960s as well. Leftist guerrilla organizations fought against the dictatorship of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00095">Somoza</term> family, which ruled until the late 1970s. Then, in 1979, one of the major leftist groups, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00096">Sandinistas</term>, took control. The Sandinistas were socialists, and within months they had opened diplomatic relations with the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00097">Soviet Union</term> and later accepted its economic and military assistance. This action alarmed the United States and led it to support resistance to the Sandinista government, which contributed to an escalation of the violence and a number of human rights abuses on both sides.</para>

    <para id="para-00025">While violence in Central America has declined in the last few decades, it persists elsewhere. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00098">Venezuela</term>, effectively a one-party state since 2007, has been accused by the United States of a number of human rights abuses. These include murder, imprisonment, torture, and government support of armed groups that commit violence against protestors. Similar accusations have been made against the governments in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00099">Colombia</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00100">Cuba</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00101">Ecuador</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00102">Peru</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00103">Chile</term>. Chile’s government committed numerous human rights abuses against its people during the dictatorship of Augusto <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00104">Pinochet</term> (1973–1990). These included torture, execution, and sexual abuse of leftist political opponents. While Pinochet has since died, human rights organizations claim the abuses continue, particularly against <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00105">Indigenous</term> groups and those identifying as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00106">LGBTQ+</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00026">Similar human rights abuses committed by authoritarian governments are also a persistent reality across much of Africa. Between April and July 1994, nearly 800,000 people were killed in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00107">Rwanda</term> when an estimated 200,000 members of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00108">Hutu</term> majority sought to wipe out the minority <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00109">Tutsi</term> population and any Hutus who tried to protect them. Armed conflicts in countries like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00110">Liberia</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00111">Burkina Faso</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00112">Cameroon</term>, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00113">Democratic Republic of the Congo</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00114">Nigeria</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00115">Somalia</term> have also led to many human rights violations. In a number of countries, militant Islamic organizations have committed civilian massacres and targeted killings. These include attacks by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00116">Boko Haram</term>, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00117">Islamic State in West Africa</term>, and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00118">Islamic State in the Greater Sahara</term>, which have been responsible for many hundreds of deaths over the last few years. In response, the governments in these countries have committed atrocities of their own. For example, in 2021, government forces in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00119">Central African Republic</term> attacked a mosque and killed fourteen people.</para>
    <para id="para-00027">Governments across Africa have often used violence to break up anti-government protests. For example, in the small southern African country of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00120">Eswatini</term> (formerly Swaziland), government forces broke up a pro-democracy protest in 2021, killing eighty people and injuring more than two hundred. Many more who protested the regime of the Eswatini king <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00121">Mswati III</term> were arrested (<link target-id="fig-00007"/>). Similar actions against protestors in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00122">Sudan</term> that year led to the deaths of fifty-three people. And other government abuses across the continent have resulted in long prison sentences and even death for protestors, whistleblowers, and journalists who have challenged government policies.</para>

The Uyghurs number about eleven million and are a mostly Muslim ethnic group of Turkic origin living in northwestern Xinjiang. The Chinese government has repressed them for decades, claiming that many hold extremist ideas about carving out their own Islamic state, which China views as a threat to its territorial integrity. Chinese policy has been to compel the Uyghurs to conform their religious beliefs more thoroughly to the state’s nationalist message and to eliminate separatist movements. Since at least as early as 2017, China has rounded up several hundred thousand Uyghurs and placed them in what it calls vocational training centers. Human rights groups, however, have described these as reeducation camps intended to compel the Uyghurs to renounce Islam and become loyal Chinese citizens. Relatively little is known about the many camps because the state controls information and denies that abuse occurs within them.</para>

    <title>The Debate Over Veils and Head Coverings</title>
    <para id="para-00032">Whether or not Muslim women should be required—or allowed—to wear <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00133">veil</term>s or head coverings is a contentious issue. In some countries with Muslim-majority populations, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00134">Iran</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00135">Saudi Arabia</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00136">Afghanistan</term>, the law requires women to veil their heads and/or faces in public. In other Muslim countries, however, women can choose whether to do so.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">Muslim women living in the West also must confront the question of whether to cover their heads and faces in public. Sometimes government authorities do not give them a choice. In 2004, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00137">France</term> banned the wearing of veils in public schools, and in 2011 it banned veils that cover the entire face, as did <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00138">Belgium</term>. Women cannot work for the French government while veiled, nor can anyone wearing an overtly religious symbol such as a crucifix or skullcap. French authorities claim these bans ensure the secular nature of the French state, a bedrock principle dating from the French Revolution and enshrined in Article 1 of the French Constitution of 1958.</para>
    <para id="para-00034">Supporters of women’s right to veil argue that such laws are a backlash against Muslim immigrants and disproportionately affect Muslim women, and they point out that French public schools celebrate Christian holidays. While conservative politicians generally support the bans, some liberals would prevent veiled women from working in day care centers, and the Socialist junior minister for women’s rights questioned whether veils should be allowed in universities.</para>
    <para id="para-00035">Muslim women themselves are divided in their opinions. Some consider veils symbols of oppression and argue that they can be good Muslims without covering themselves. One New York City woman explained, “I am a Muslim woman, and I have never worn a veil, nor has my mother or her sisters. . . . While we are devoted to Islam, we believe that God exists on the inside and not in outward symbols that are too often thwarted and perverted by political interests.”</para>
    <para id="para-00036">Many others voluntarily choose to wear veils or headscarves and do not feel pressured to do so. They consider them a symbol of their cultural identity or religious piety. One young Muslim American woman explained to the <emphasis effect="italics">New York Times</emphasis>, “I chose to start wearing the veil three years ago, even though the girls in my family don’t. I chose to wear it myself after I studied Islam and thought it was a beautiful way to express my love for my religion and nothing more.”</para>

    <para id="para-00038">Many of the economic problems in the Global South can be traced to imperial exploitation, sometimes going back centuries. Countries in the Global North, especially in Europe, tended to reap the benefits of this exploitation. The legacy of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00147">colonialism</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00148">imperialism</term> in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and southern Asia continues to affect these countries in the form of high levels of government corruption, poorly developed industries, and borders drawn for the benefit of imperialist powers rather than by the groups living there. In Africa, borders charted to benefit imperialist powers often separated members of the same ethnic group into different countries while forcing hostile groups into the same country. Violent ethnic conflict has been a frequent result.</para>
    <para id="para-00039">Even Global South countries that are resource-rich have struggled to develop their economies over the past few decades. Indeed, they often have more difficulty responding to their domestic needs than countries that are relatively resource-poor. This problem, sometimes dubbed the <term id="term-00149">resource curse</term>, a term coined by British economist Richard <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00150">Auty</term> in 1993, makes resource-rich countries prone to authoritarianism, high rates of conflict, and low rates of economic growth. Resource-poor countries typically use citizens’ taxes for the majority of government funding, resulting in greater public scrutiny over how that money is used and governments that are more responsive to public needs. In contrast, governments in resource-rich countries are able to tap into profit-producing extractive industries like oil production to fund public expenditures. Because that profit is often quite large, opportunities for government corruption abound. Efforts to capture more profit also contribute to conflict and sometimes authoritarian regimes, as politicians use money to reward political supporters and fund security forces that silence opponents and stamp out protest. There is also typically less public scrutiny of potential corruption.</para>

    <para id="para-00041">The African country of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00151">Angola</term>, rich in diamonds and oil, has struggled with the resource curse. In 2018, oil made up more than 92 percent of its exports, and the oil industry accounted for about a third of its GDP. Since achieving independence from Portugal in 1975, the country has experienced internal wars and massacres. For much of this period, until 2017, Angola was ruled by José Eduardo <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00152">dos Santos</term>, who was routinely criticized internationally for election fraud, corruption, and authoritarianism. Much of his power was derived from the oil rents paid to him by oil companies operating in Angola, which he used to oppress his opposition, maintain his hold on power, and shower his family and close contacts with favors and money. The oil rents were substantial, but relatively little of this money actually trickled down to the country’s largely impoverished people (<link target-id="fig-00012"/>). Strife also weakened Angola’s ability to feed itself. Famine conditions prevailed in the 1980s and 1990s, and many educated and skilled workers left for opportunities abroad. In 2019, the percentage of the population below the national poverty line was 41 percent, 30 percent of adults had not completed primary schooling, and 53 percent of the country had no access to electricity.</para>

    <para id="para-00044">While both organizations can point to their many achievements, they have occasionally made problems worse. Critics like the economist Joseph <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00161">Stiglitz</term>, for instance, point to the many conditions the IMF imposes on countries when it comes to help. These include increased privatization, elimination of protectionist policies, higher interest rates, and austerity measures that reduce government spending. Such conditions, Stiglitz and others have noted, tend to benefit foreign creditors from the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00162">Global North</term> and hurt poor workers in the countries the IMF purports to be saving. Similar criticisms have been directed against the World Bank. Many have argued that the organization lacks representation from the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00163">Global South</term>, so poor countries have relatively little influence within the organization and on its policies and actions.</para>

    <para id="para-00045">When the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, it seemed possible to many in the West that the United States would lead the world into a new era of universal liberal democracy. But in 2001, the September 11 attacks by the terrorist group al-Qaeda prompted the United States to begin wars in Afghanistan and then in Iraq. The mistakes made in Iraq damaged the reputation of the United States and weakened its ability to preserve stability in the world. Its intervention in Iraq also spurred the growth of the Islamic State, responsible for violent attacks in Iraq, Syria, and Africa.</para>
    <para id="para-00046">Violence, civil war, and persecution have led large numbers of refugees from the Middle East and Africa to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. Their arrival has provoked some resistance, and a number of ultranationalist groups have sprung up in the United States and Europe. The migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border is partly the result of violence and instability in a number of Latin American countries, such as civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.</para>
    <para id="para-00047">Violence and human rights abuses have plagued Sub-Saharan Africa for decades. Many occur in the Global South, and critics have connected the economic problems there to the region’s history of imperial exploitation by countries in the Global North. One of these problems is the resource curse, or the difficulty of responding to domestic needs faced by resource-rich countries.</para>
