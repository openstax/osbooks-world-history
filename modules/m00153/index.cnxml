    <para id="para-00002">Beginning in the eighth century, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Khyber Pass</term>, renowned as the means by which Alexander the Great and his army traveled from Afghanistan to India, made it possible for a new religious tradition to enter northern India. This tradition was <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Islam</term>, which soon came to dominate the areas of modern-day Pakistan and Bangladesh as well as portions of India. In time, Muslims created the powerful <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Delhi Sultanate</term>, which stretched from the Punjab in the northwest to Bengal in the northeast.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">Islam arrived in China during the early Tang period (618–690 CE) by way of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Silk Roads</term> trade as well as through diplomatic missions sent to the Tang court at <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Chang’an</term> by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Umayyad</term> caliph at Damascus. Before Islam’s appearance in China, the Tang dynasty, like its predecessor the Sui, had been influenced by the Indian tradition of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Buddhism</term>; the Sui emperor and his Tang cousins adhered to many Buddhist precepts. Monumental constructions such as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Grand Canal</term> and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Huaisheng Mosque</term>, which was built in the seventh century CE and stands today in Guangzhou, demonstrate the grandeur of these two dynasties.

    <title>South Asia in the Early Middle Ages</title>
    <para id="para-00004"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">India</term>, usually referred to as South Asia, shares the Asian subcontinent, culture, and history with several countries in the modern period, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. Before the Middle Ages, two powerful religious and philosophical traditions emerged there, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Hinduism</term> and Buddhism, the latter spreading by traveling merchants via the Silk Roads, both overland and overseas.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">In the fourth century BCE, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Alexander the Great</term>, his army, and his people came to what is today Afghanistan and the region of the Hindu Kush. Although they did not remain there, for the next three centuries this Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom continued to trade with India and spread Greek ideas. The arrival of Alexander’s army in the region was a crucial step in the process of bringing the Afro-Eurasian world closer together. Long-distance travel in this period was still arduous and undertaken primarily by merchants, but important cultural shifts were beginning. Although Alexander’s death shortly after his Indian campaigns meant that neither he nor his successors came to rule over this part of the world, disparate and previously separate cultures and peoples began sharing material goods, technologies, and ideas in ways that only continued as the centuries passed. This change was accelerated by the rise of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Mauryan Empire</term>, the first major kingdom to dominate the Asian subcontinent. The Mauryan Empire was founded by Chandragupta Maurya in 322 BCE and lasted until around 185 BCE. During that time, the region saw great intellectual developments, such as the implementation of place value in numbers and the addition of zero to the numbering system, while long-distance trade continued to expand and widen the spread of these new ideas and concepts.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">While India experienced a time of unity and great success during the Mauryan age, the subcontinent again broke into separate kingdoms following invasions by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">White Huns</term>, which fatally weakened the empire. One of the more stable regimes to emerge in this period was the northern kingdom of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Thanesar</term>, under its Buddhist ruler <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Harsha</term> Vardhana, whose reign lasted from 606 to 647 CE. We know a great deal about Harsha thanks to contemporary accounts by the Indian poet <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Bana</term> and the Chinese Buddhist monk <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Xuan Zang</term>. According to both, Buddhism had penetrated the region surrounding Thanesar to a considerable degree, despite the Guptas’ earlier favoring of Hinduism. It was also clear, though, that Buddhism had declined as a result of Gupta neglect because its monasteries throughout India were in a state of disrepair. Still, Xuan Zang found Harsha’s kingdom well run, wealthy, and justly administered. As far as the monk was concerned, Thanesar was a model state. It did not outlive its king by many years, however. Soon after Harsha’s death, the Arab advance that began in the early part of his reign had become a wave that, in the early eighth century, swept across northern India.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">In the early seventh century, the new religion of Islam had begun to expand, encompassing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Arabia</term> and soon spreading even farther. By 659, Muslim forces were advancing eastward and clashed with the rulers of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Sindh</term> in modern-day Pakistan; by the early eighth century, armies of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">Umayyad</term> Islamic state had conquered the region. Under increasing pressure from foreign invaders, India splintered into rival principalities ruled by independent rajas, or princes. These kingdoms, which extended from the Indus River valley in northwestern India to the Ganges River in the northeast, flourished for a time. However, long centuries of fending off invasions by Islamized Turkic warlords from central Asia had taken their toll.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">The career of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Mahmud</term> of Ghazna is a good example of these developments. The son of a Turkic mamluk, or military slave, who ruled from 998 to 1030, Mahmud was intent on developing his region as an important Islamic state and launched dozens of campaigns against the princes of northern India from his base in Afghanistan. The onslaught was quite successful, for by the twelfth century, the Muslim <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Ghaznavid</term> dynasty ruled an area that stretched from the Aral Sea in the north to Lahore in the east and encompassed the vital Silk Roads conduit of Khurasan in the southwest (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). The Muslim advance did not end with the establishment of the Ghaznavid state, however. Wars raged across northern India, and by the end of the twelfth century, the remaining independent Indian princes had become fatally weakened. Vulnerable to conquest, the kingdoms of the rajas collapsed.</para>

    <para id="para-00009">In the twelfth century, a new line of Turkic invaders arose in present-day Afghanistan, led by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Muhammad of Ghur</term> (Ghur was an especially important town in the region). A Persian ruler subject to the Ghaznavids, Muhammad declared his independence from Ghazna and conquered most of the lands of his former lords. In 1192, his forces defeated an army of some 100,000 <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Rajputs</term>, considered Hindu India’s most ferocious warriors, in one of the most violent engagements of his increasingly bloody career. The crowning achievement of Muhammad’s campaigns was establishing a Muslim state at Delhi, deep in the heart of northern India. It endured as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Delhi Sultanate</term> for more than three centuries (1206–1526), during which time it was the center of Islamic India (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>).</para>

However, the absence of larger cities in the center and south-center of the subcontinent meant that Indigenous peoples there were less likely to come into contact with Islam and its practitioners, so this region was not under the control of an Islamic state.

    <para id="para-00010">Thus, through a series of invasions over the course of some five hundred years, Arab and then Turkic invaders made their way into northern India, bringing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">Islam</term> and stimulating political integration in the process. Because the minority Muslim rulers did not enforce cultural homogeneity, the invasions also strengthened the cultural diversity that was already a hallmark of Indian social order. For example, the Islamic rulers of the sultanate gave Hindu subjects the status of <emphasis effect="italics">dhimmis</emphasis>, which protected their rights as non-Muslims, although they still had to pay the special tax, the <emphasis effect="italics">jizya</emphasis>, placed on non-believers. The sultans of Delhi often employed Hindu laborers on construction projects such as the building of mosques, which led Muslims to integrate certain forms of Hindu symbolism and motifs such as trees and plant life into the structures. In the fourteenth century, Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq expanded and even encouraged Hindu religious freedom, himself participating in Holi, the annual celebration of spring, while he allowed Hindu pilgrimages to the Ganges River, Hinduism’s holiest site.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">Before the arrival of Islam in South Asia, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Hinduism</term> was the dominant religion in the subcontinent. The result of a synthesis of beliefs that occurred after the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">Vedic</term> period of Ancient <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">India</term> (c. 1500–500 BCE) and a response to Buddhism’s commercial and urban influence, Hinduism developed a philosophy and belief system more widely accessible to the rural and agrarian peoples of India. An elaborate universe of Hindu deities was also established that included divinities from other religions, widening Hinduism’s accessibility and appeal. Perhaps most importantly, Hinduism stressed personal devotion to a particular deity to obtain a truly individualized religious experience.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">The Muslim <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">Turks</term> who arrived in India in the twelfth century recognized the Hindus as a protected people, allowing them to practice their own religious traditions and govern individual territories so long as they paid taxes and tribute. Buddhists, however, were not given the same measures of religious freedom, although it is not clear why. They were forced to flee or be executed, and many went to areas of Southeast Asia, Nepal, or Tibet, where <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">Buddhism</term> remains a major religion today. Over time, in the northern areas of the Indian subcontinent, which include modern Pakistan and Bangladesh, many Hindus converted to Islam, which then became the majority religion of the region. In the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">Vijanagar Empire</term> in southern India, on the other hand, far fewer conversions took place, perhaps due to its distance from the centers of Islam.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">In 1221, the province of Khurasan, which had invaded the Punjab in the tenth century, was itself invaded by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">Mongols</term> from China, led by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">Chinggis Khan</term> (often referred to as “Genghis Khan” in the West). The Mongols then turned their attention to the Delhi Sultanate, which managed to successfully weather an attempted Mongol invasion in 1222. Over the next several decades, northern India experienced a series of invasions accompanying renewed Mongol expansion. Although most were repelled, countless Muslims were displaced and resettled on sultanate lands deeper in the subcontinent’s interior.</para>

    <title>A Multicultural South Asia</title>
    <para id="para-00014">Throughout the decline of the independent principalities of northern India and, ultimately, the conquest of the Delhi Sultanate, the north slowly became increasingly Muslim, while the south retained Hindu cultural beliefs and ideas. By the thirteenth century, Buddhism had diminished as a popular form of worship in India and Hinduism had evolved from a religion in which only priests offered sacrifices to one in which a wider array of people could actively participate. With this change came increased personal devotion to the individual gods, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">Vishnu</term> and Shiva (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>). Each village usually had a temple in which they were enshrined and worshipped, and various incarnations of the gods developed from these numerous local beliefs. For example, Krishna was an incarnation of Vishnu. Eventually, Vishnu and Shiva came to have consort wives, and their powers could not be activated except through union. Thus, many female deities also came to be worshipped. In contrast, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Confucianism all feature male-centered systems.</para>

    <para id="para-00015">The Hindu religion evolved to become the dominant religion likely because it was a belief system with broader appeal than Buddhism. Originating in the period following the Vedic Age (c. 1500–500 BCE) and evolving over centuries, Hinduism developed from much older traditions, especially those of the Aryan peoples who arrived in India beginning in the third millennium BCE. One particularly distinctive facet of Hindu tradition that originated among these peoples was the Indian <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">caste system</term>. At its origin, the caste system was limited, and all of society was organized into four categories known as <emphasis effect="italics">varnas</emphasis>. The four major <emphasis effect="italics">varnas</emphasis> were Brahman (priests), Kshatriya (warriors), Vaishya (merchants and farmers), and Shudra (servile people). In these early days of the system, a person’s <emphasis effect="italics">varna</emphasis> was determined by their profession but also their <term id="term-00043">dharma</term>—their adherence to proper behaviors for their caste as stipulated by cosmic law, including avoiding contact with lower castes—and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">karma</term> they accrued by virtue of their dharma (<link target-id="fig-00004"/>).</para>

    <para id="para-00016">Karma worked both ways: A believer’s failure to follow their dharma resulted in negative residue, whereas faithful obedience resulted in positive residue. At the personal level, the incentive behind amassing karma was <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">samsara</term>, the continuance of the soul after death and the soul’s transformation. The more positive karma someone built up, the greater the chances of being reincarnated in a higher <emphasis effect="italics">varna</emphasis> in the next life—with the ultimate goal being the attainment of <term id="term-00046">moksha</term>, or release from the karmic cycle and the achievement of a complete understanding of the world.

    <para id="para-00018">The basic social unit of Indian society and the focus of life was the extended family, which included parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and in-laws. Most peasant families lived in villages and worked as farmers. Farming was more important than cattle raising for several reasons, not least the prohibition against eating cows. Hindus believe these animals to be sacred but also used them as draft animals on farms. Their manure helped fertilize crops, and their milk was a sustaining element of the Hindu diet. Key crops were rice, millet, wheat, barley, lentils, and peas. The extended family’s large web of relationships encouraged everyone to work together for the betterment of the community. Villages were usually walled, with gates that were shut at night after the farmers returned from the fields.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">Like Confucianism in China, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">Hinduism</term> fostered a patriarchal family structure in which women were subservient. Men were viewed as stronger than women and less governed by their emotions, while older men, due to age and presumed experience, were thought to be wiser than younger men and thus superior to all others. Male domination of Hindu family life was reinforced by the fact that the oldest male was head of the household and might have several wives, who generally came to live with their husband’s parents.</para>
    <para id="para-00020">Although children often assisted the family in daily work such as farming, in wealthier homes the basics such as reading, writing, and arithmetic might be taught. Daughters were often married at a young age, and finding the ideal husband—who could provide for the family financially—was a key concern. A wife had no life apart from her husband, and if widowed, she might shave her head, sleep on the floor, eat only a single meal a day, and avoid attending family festivals. A wealthier widow, particularly from the Kshatriya or warrior caste, might throw herself on her husband’s funeral pyre in an act of ritual suicide known as <emphasis effect="italics">sati</emphasis>.</para>

    <para id="para-00021">Abu Zayd al-Sirafi was a sailor from Sirafi, a center of the spice trade, who traveled throughout the Indian Ocean during the tenth century.

    <quote id="quote-00001"><para id="para-00022">Moving now to India, if a man accuses another of an offense for which the mandatory penalty is death, the accuser is asked, “Will you subject the person you have accused to ordeal by fire?” If he agrees to this, a piece of iron is first heated to such a high temperature that it becomes red-hot. The accused man is told to hold out his hand, palm up, and on it are placed seven leaves from a particular tree of theirs; the red-hot iron is then placed on his hand, on top of the leaves. Next, the accused has to walk up and down holding the iron, until he can bear it no longer and has to drop it. At this point, a leather bag is brought out: the man has to put his hand inside this, then the bag is sealed with the ruler’s seal. When three days have passed, some unhusked rice is brought, and the accused man is told to husk it by rubbing it between his palms. If after this no mark is found on his hand, he is deemed to have got the better of his accuser, and he escapes execution. Moreover, his accuser is fined a maund [about 82 pounds] of gold, which the ruler appropriates for himself. On some occasions, they heat water in an iron or copper cauldron until it boils so furiously that no one can go near it. An iron finger-ring is then dropped into the water, and the accused man is told to put his hand in and retrieve the ring. I have seen a man put his hand in and bring it out unharmed. In such a case, too, his accuser is fined a maund of gold.</para>

    <para id="para-00024">Toward the end of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">Gupta</term> period, in the sixth century, rulers began giving land grants to officials and Brahman priests to help stimulate local economies. Often entire villages were included in the gifts, and their inhabitants came under the control of the grantees. Eventually, land grants were also awarded to temples and monasteries, in the hope that this could encourage wider economic growth and lessen dependence on the central state.</para>
    <para id="para-00025">Although this was a politically chaotic period, new ideas and belief systems spread and many cultural and technological advances occurred. Improvements in shipbuilding and textile manufacturing stimulated coastal trade, for example, especially in Southeast Asia. Paradoxically, many such developments were the result of the same forces that destabilized India’s politics, for the continual invasions and migrations of foreigners in the north cross-fertilized the region’s cultural base, producing new ideas and practical innovations. The diffusion of ideas was enhanced by India’s annual monsoon winds, which lengthened maritime traders’ exposure to Indian society and culture by preventing those who arrived in summer from returning home until the winter monsoon season.</para>
    <para id="para-00026">One of the most influential and enduring effects of trade was the spread of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">Buddhism</term>, which began to take hold elsewhere as it competed with, and in some ways reshaped, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">Hinduism</term>.

By the first century BCE, there were two branches of Buddhism: <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">Theravada</term> (“the path of the elders,” the oldest extant form of Buddhism) and Mahayana (“the greater vehicle”). <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">Mahayana</term>, the larger branch, spread along the great trade routes of Asia into the borderlands of the Parthian Empire, eventually reaching China, Korea, and Japan, where it was gradually infused with local ideas. Theravada Buddhism established itself in Sri Lanka, southern India, and parts of Southeast Asia. Unlike Hinduism, Buddhism did not emphasize the caste system and in many instances opposed it, thus strengthening its influence abroad. It therefore appealed to lower-caste individuals as well. Nonetheless, Hinduism influenced many monarchies, particularly through the concept of dharma. Sanskrit, the written language of India, also spread to many southeast Asian courts, cementing the broad influence of Indian culture.</para>

    <para id="para-00029">A Mongol general from northern China, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061">Yang Jian</term>, was an affirmed Buddhist. His military abilities allowed him to gain such fame that he was able to create a marriage alliance between one of his daughters and a northern prince. With growing power, at the death of the ruler, he claimed the role of regent to his grandson before later deposing him. Yang then made himself the first emperor of the new Sui dynasty in 581 and adopted the name Wen. Emperor Wen gained his soldiers’ allegiance by granting them lands acquired through conquest, a years-long process that reunified most of the old Han lands. To consolidate his control over the empire, Emperor Wen created a powerful centralized government, with loyal bureaucrats appointed to rule its many territories. To eliminate the risk that these powerful regional administrators could amass followers into a rebellious army, Wen periodically moved them to different territories, forcing them to build new networks from scratch.</para>
    <para id="para-00030">Emperor Wen was succeeded by his son Yang Guang. Like his father before him, Emperor <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00062">Yang Di</term>, as Yang was known, was ambitious and grandiose.

The canal made the movement of foodstuffs and supplies between north and south possible on an unimaginable scale. From the south, with its warmer and wetter climate, came rice; from the drier and cooler north came crops such as wheat and millet (<link target-id="fig-00007"/>). A crucial step in the economic integration of overland trade was taken when the canal was connected to the Sui capital and eastern terminus of the Silk Roads in Chang’an, finally extending all the way north to Beijing. Construction of this arm of the canal took seven years and required as many as five million workers, sometimes including entire populations conscripted to labor on the project. An early form of a police force supervised, enforcing corporal punishment on anyone refusing to work.</para>

    <para id="para-00032">The modern city of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00066">Hangzhou</term>, situated at the head of a large bay extending out into the East China Sea, has a population of almost twelve million and is known around the country and world for its robust economy. One of the keys to Hangzhou’s success is the busy canal that extends northward from the city and is plied around the clock by numerous barges carrying bulk materials to distant locations in the interior. The origins of the canal date back over two thousand years to pre-imperial China, and its use today is a reminder of the enduring legacy of ancient Chinese engineering and determination.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">Commonly referred to as the Grand Canal, this man-made waterway has portions that were built in the fifth century BCE. But it was during the Sui dynasty when these older canals were connected, refurbished, and extended to create a continuous water route stretching 1,100 miles from Hangzhou to Beijing. Built with conscripted workers, it was intended to supply southern-produced grain to the large cities in the north, facilitate the movement of troops, and to generally better integrate the northern and southern portions of the vast empire.</para>
    <para id="para-00034">Completing the canal, fitted with lock gates to regulate water levels over different elevations, was an engineering feat and a testament to the boldness of the emperor. It was supplemented by a parallel imperial road dotted with post offices. Unfortunately for the enslaved, peasants, and others conscripted to build it, the costs were enormous. An estimated two million workers died constructing the canal; and the cost in both lives and taxes almost certainly contributed to the downfall of the short-lived Sui dynasty in 618. Later dynasties, however, found the canal quite useful. By the fifteenth century, hundreds of years of expansions and technological improvements had made the Grand Canal the central feature of a vast and indispensable inland transportation network (<link target-id="fig-00008"/>).</para>

    <para id="para-00036">In the end, and despite the great benefits of the Grand Canal, its construction overextended the Sui. Enormously costly in labor and materiel, the waterway became a great source of grievance among the Chinese people, millions of whom were forced to work on it and neglect their families and farms. The situation was worsened by the combined effects of a natural disaster—the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067">Yellow River</term> flooded the North China plain and triggered famine throughout the countryside—and military defeat—the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00068">Sui</term> invasion of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00069">Korea</term> was repelled in 612. Undaunted, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00070">Yang Di</term> pushed ahead with a second invasion campaign, stopping only when the exhausted military revolted.

    <para id="para-00037">The Tang Empire, which lasted until 907, emerged just as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00073">Islam</term> exploded out of Arabia and swept across North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula and into central Asia. Like the great Islamic empires that thrived during this period, the Tang promoted a cosmopolitan culture, a character greatly enhanced by wider international developments. In 674, for example, the advancing tide of Arab armies from the west forced members of the Sasanian royal family to flee to the safety of the Tang court at <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00074">Chang’an</term>, at the eastern terminus of the Silk Roads. This event inspired whole communities of merchants to move from Sasanian Persia to the Chinese capital, bringing all manner of exotic products and luxury goods, from silver artwork to Arab, Persian, and central Asian musical forms and dance.</para>
    <para id="para-00038">It did not take long for the Tang elite to develop a taste for these items, creating an impressive industry of Persian-Arab-inspired goods and services to meet the growing demand. As a taste for Persian-Arab culture spread, trade relations between the Tang and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00075">India</term> blossomed, bringing everything from mathematics to new sciences and medicines to China. These different cultural streams met in Tang China’s major cities, which soon generated a diverse international culture greatly enhanced by the presence of merchant communities of Jewish people, Christians, Zoroastrians, peoples of the major Indian traditions, and a sizable minority of Muslims.</para>
    <para id="para-00039">For much of its duration, Tang China was the most powerful empire in existence, and among its priorities was completing the consolidation and expansion begun under the Sui. To this end, the Tang embarked on a series of military campaigns into central Asia. Their large professional army was organized around a core of aristocratic cavalry of some seven million troops who routinely clashed with the mounted nomads of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00076">Inner Asian Steppe</term>, and an immense peasant infantry several million strong and garrisoned in the interior. By the 750s, Tang frontier units increasingly relied on pastoral nomadic peoples from the steppes, such as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00077">Uyghurs</term>, Turkish-speaking peoples who constituted the empire’s most potent military force. Over time, Tang forces pushed into Manchuria (the area immediately north of the Korean Peninsula), Vietnam, and Tibet. At its height in the late ninth century, the Tang army controlled more than four million square miles of territory, an area roughly the size of the entire Islamic world during the same period.</para>
    <para id="para-00040">The Tang achieved several early foreign policy successes, including reestablishing Chinese rule over Korea in 668, resulting in a tributary relationship with the peninsula’s Silla dynasty. The Tang also opened diplomatic relations with Japan, which proved so effective that in 645 Japan embarked on its “<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00078">Great Reform</term>”—an all-encompassing adoption of Tang culture, including its imperial institutions (which the Silla also adopted), Confucian bureaucracy, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00079">Buddhism</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00041">The spread of Tang culture was greatly enhanced by several major innovations in China, including the world’s first block-printing process, which proved opportune for printing Buddhist scriptures (<link target-id="fig-00009"/>). Like the Sui, the Tang embraced and promoted Buddhism, the scriptures of which were usually hand-copied by scribes and disseminated among students. The scarcity of these works meant that most commoners and even many elites had no access to them. China’s artisans, however, devised a way to carve the mirror-image of a text into a block of wood, add ink, and then press the block onto paper. Scriptures and other forms of writing now became more accessible, spreading ideas from the elites to the masses. Block-printing remained the major method of transferring images onto paper until the end of the nineteenth century.</para>

Like the Hindu <emphasis effect="italics">bhakti</emphasis> sects in India, Pure Land Buddhists held that to achieve salvation it was necessary not to study sacred texts but rather to engage in practices accessible to everyone, especially by invoking Amida’s name.</para>
    <para id="para-00043"><term id="term-00083">Chan Buddhism</term>, like Pure Land, deemphasized scriptural study but rejected the notion of personal devotion to a savior. Instead, Chan Buddhism, known more popularly by its Japanese name <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00084">Zen</term>, stressed the disciplined practice of meditation and following the example of a Chan master, who underwent great hardships performing humble tasks and wrestling with paradoxical questions, to achieve enlightenment. Chan Buddhism was austere and monastic in character, whereas Pure Land was the more popular form observed by lay people.</para>
    <para id="para-00044">Buddhism’s popularity became a flashpoint for violence in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00085">Tang</term> China, however. In the mid-ninth century, the Tang Empire cracked down on what it perceived as the threat that hundreds of thousands of Buddhist monks and nuns posed to its Confucian and Daoist leaders, who argued that Buddhism represented an alien influence on the state. Although this prompted the active suppression of Buddhist monasteries and the confiscation of their wealth, it was not enough. Blatant persecution unfolded under Emperor <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00086">Wuzong</term>, resulting in the destruction of some forty thousand temples and shrines, the closure of more than four thousand monasteries, and the forced secularization of hundreds of thousands of Buddhist monks and nuns.

    <para id="para-00045">The Tang period also produced a great deal of poetry, much of it influenced by the prevalent religious and philosophical traditions.

Along the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00092">Silk Roads</term> during this period, poetry spread along with China’s religious and philosophical traditions, first to Korea and from there to Japan.

    <para id="para-00046">Entrance into the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00093">Tang</term> bureaucracy was based on passage of a merit-based exam administered every three years. This civil service exam, the first fully written such exam in history, had been developed from the Sui dynasty and tested sophisticated literary skills and knowledge of Confucian and Daoist classics. In theory it was open to all; in practice, however, until the late Tang period, women, the sons of merchants, and those who could not afford a classical education were excluded. Most laborers were also excluded because of their circumstances, as they could not take time away from their fields to study. In the end, people became government officials thanks to their literary achievements or the influence of their prestigious families.</para>
    <para id="para-00047">Tang China also witnessed contradictory trends in personal behavior and relations between the sexes. In 665, Emperor <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00094">Gaozong</term>, infirm and sickly, handed power to his second wife, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00095">Wu</term> Zetian. Following Gaozong’s death in 683, Wu ruled as empress dowager and regent for her son, though she held all the real power of the state. A devout Buddhist, she declared <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00096">Buddhism</term> the state religion, ordered scholars to write biographies of famous women, and in 690 took the extraordinary step of founding her own dynasty, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00097">Wu Zhou</term> (not to be confused with the much earlier Zhou dynasty). Three years later, Wu assumed the Buddhist title “Divine Empress Who Rules the Universe.” Although she was an intelligent and competent ruler, the founding of her own dynasty and the adoption of imperial titles felt to many like usurpation. Resistance soon followed, prompting her abdication and the restoration of the Tang dynasty.</para>
    <para id="para-00048">Wu’s reign was remarkable in China’s male-dominated society. Still, the Tang Empire has been described as a “golden age” for women in China, perhaps because lingering contact with the nomadic peoples of the north and their relatively egalitarian society encouraged a somewhat similar view among the Chinese. As evidence of the increased prominence of women, historians also point to a flourishing culture of poetry written by courtesans, the careers of Empress Wu and her daughter-in-law Empress Wei, and the practice of using diplomatic marriages of Tang daughters to prominent foreign officials to forge political alliances. However, sumptuary laws dictated what women could and could not wear, elite men kept concubines, and the Tang legal system considered women property.</para>
    <para id="para-00049">The Tang Empire reached its zenith in the early eighth century (<link target-id="fig-00011"/>).

    <para id="para-00051">The new religion of Islam came into India with waves of invaders, from Turkic speakers of central Asia to Arabs from the distant west. In the process, northeastern India became increasingly Muslim and influenced by Islamic culture owing to the arrival of these Turkic peoples. An Islamic state was established at Delhi—the Delhi Sultanate—which lasted more than three hundred years and became the center of Islamic India. However, because the minority Muslim rulers did not enforce cultural homogeneity, the invasions strengthened the cultural diversity that was already a hallmark of Indian social order.
