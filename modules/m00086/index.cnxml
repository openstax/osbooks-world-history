      <title>About <emphasis effect="italics">World History</emphasis></title>
      <para id="para-00009"><emphasis effect="italics">World History</emphasis> is designed to support both semesters of the world history course offered at both two-year and four-year institutions. Serving a student base of both majors and non-majors in the field, as well as an institutional variation in requirements of one or two semesters depending on the plan of study, the course introduces students to a global perspective of history conveyed within an engaging narrative. Concepts and assessments are presented in ways to help students think critically about the issues they encounter so they can broaden their perspective of global history and how the topics studied apply to their current life as citizens of the world.</para>
      <para id="para-00010">The text overtly shows how historical content and the ways in which history is studied are relevant to modern-day needs and situations. The narrative shows readers the <emphasis effect="italics">why</emphasis> of historical events and people, providing context and import to engage students. A primary goal of the book is to include content, scholarship, and activities that explore a variety of perspectives, including those traditionally underrepresented in this canon.</para>
      <para id="para-00011">Being able to thoughtfully achieve a global approach requires explicit discussions about the challenge historians face in their work. Each instructor and student enters the classroom with a construct that informs their existing understanding as well as their ability to understand and to appreciate novel perspectives. <emphasis effect="italics">World History</emphasis> works to present an honest and authentic view of history for students to explore. Balance is sought not by scrubbing the content to a neutral presentation, but by introducing and juxtaposing people’s experiences of history for a rich and nuanced discussion. New resources and new voices are integrated into the text to be studied, not just as tokenism. Primary source material represents the cultures being discussed from a firsthand perspective whenever possible, showing a variety of experiences and voices that stress the interconnected nature of people and societies throughout history. Moreover, the work of diverse and underrepresented scholars and scholarship bolsters the text’s ability to embrace diversity of thought and interpretation while spotlighting parts of history and places that often receive less coverage in history textbooks. Students will be challenged to use empathy to understand others’ ways of thinking in order to better understand, analyze, and evaluate today’s changes in the world.</para>

      <title>Learning Objectives</title>
      <para id="para-00012">Every module begins with a set of clear and concise learning objectives that have been designed to be both measurable and meaningful. These objectives closely align with current teaching practice and aim to help the instructor decide what content to include or assign, and to guide student expectations of learning. After completing the module and end-of-module exercises, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives.</para>

      <title>Key Features</title>
      <para id="para-00013">Various features throughout each chapter engage students with the content while having them practice some of the most essential skills in the study of history, such as the examination of primary sources, the analysis of multiple accounts of an event or period, the study of non-textual artifacts, and the exploration of how specific historical topics connect to today's world.</para>
      <list id="list-00001">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">In Their Own Words:</emphasis> Students are presented with a textual primary source for review and/or analysis, with discussion/reflection questions included. This feature bolsters the foundational importance of using primary sources in historical studies.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Dueling Voices:</emphasis> Learners are given either a historiographical debate, or a side-by-side primary source reading that offers two different interpretations of the same event. Sometimes these are directly contrasting, and sometimes they help elucidate different perspectives. Discussion questions are included. This feature highlights that history is an interpretive discipline and that historians must regularly grapple with conflicting and at times contradictory information and approaches.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Beyond the Book:</emphasis> Non-textual sources— such as art, physical objects, or architecture—are presented for study with the goal of helping students understand the value of these kinds of sources in historical work. Discussion questions open up conversations about how to understand these important artifacts.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">The Past Meets the Present:</emphasis> Students explore how an aspect of chapter content speaks to an issue in the present day, and have the opportunity to engage further in the topic with reflection/discussion questions.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Link to Learning:</emphasis> This feature provides a very brief introduction to online resources—videos, interactives, collections, maps, and other engaging resources—that are pertinent to students’ exploration of the topic at hand.</item>
