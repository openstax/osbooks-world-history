    <para id="para-00002">In the centuries following the collapse of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Bronze Age</term> Mycenaean kingdoms around 1100 BCE, a dynamic new culture evolved in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Iron Age</term> Greece and the Aegean region. During this period, the Greek city-states developed innovative consensual governments. Free adult males participated in their own governance and voted to create laws and impose taxes. This system of government contrasted with the earlier monarchies of the ancient Near East, in which rulers claimed to govern their subjects through the will of the gods.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">The degree of political participation in the Greek city-states varied from monarchy and oligarchy, or government by a small group of wealthy elites, to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">democracy</term>, literally “rule by the people,” a broader-based participation that eventually included both rich and poor adult males. These systems influenced Ancient Roman and European political thought through the centuries. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Greek Classical period</term> (500–323 BCE) witnessed constant warfare among rival city-states, yet it was marked by the creation of enduring works of literature and art that inspired centuries of European artists and writers. Greek philosophers also subjected the human condition and the natural world to rational analysis, rejecting traditional beliefs and sacred myths.</para>

    <title>Archaic Greece</title>
    <para id="para-00004">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Greek Dark Ages</term> (1100–800 BCE) persisted after the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization but began to recede around 800 BCE. From this point and for the next few centuries, Greece experienced a revival in which a unique and vibrant culture emerged and evolved into what we recognize today as Classical Greek civilization. This era, from 800 to 500 BCE, is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Archaic Greece</term> after <emphasis effect="italics">arche</emphasis>, Greek for “beginning.”</para>
    <para id="para-00005">The Greek renaissance was marked by rapid population growth and the organization of valleys and islands into independent city-states, each known as a <term id="term-00010">polis</term> (Greek for city-state). Towns arose around a hill fortress or <emphasis effect="italics">acropolis</emphasis> to which inhabitants could flee in times of danger. Each polis had its own government and religious cults, and each built monumental temples for the gods, such as the temple of Hera, wife of Zeus and protector of marriage and the home, at the city-state of Argos. Though politically disunited, the Greeks, who began to refer to themselves as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Hellenes</term> after the mythical king Hellen, did share a common language and religion. The most famous of their sacred sites were <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Delphi</term>, near <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Mount Parnassus</term> in central Greece and seat of the oracle of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Apollo</term>, the god of prophecy, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Olympia</term> in southern Greece, sacred to Zeus, who ruled the pantheon of gods at Mount Olympus (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). Beginning in 776 BCE, according to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Aristotle</term>, Greeks traveled to Olympia every four years to compete in athletic contests in Zeus’s honor, the origin of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Olympic Games</term>.</para>

    <title>The Olympic Games</title>
    <para id="para-00006">Postponed a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Japan included more than three hundred events in thirty-three sports, including new entries like skateboarding, rock climbing, and surfing. Modern games have been held since 1896, when the new International Olympic Committee started the tradition, but as the name suggests, the inspiration came from Ancient Greece.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">Athletic events in Ancient Greece were important displays of strength and endurance. There were contests at the sanctuaries at Delphi and Nemea (near Argos), but none was as renowned as the Olympic Games, held at the sanctuary in Olympia that was dedicated to Zeus. Contestants came from all over the Greek world, including Sicily and southern Italy.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">Unlike the skateboarding and surfing of modern games, the ancient games focused on skills necessary for war: running, jumping, throwing, and wrestling. Over time, sports that included horses, like chariot racing, were also incorporated. Such events were referenced in Homer’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018"><emphasis effect="italics">Iliad</emphasis></term>, when the hero Achilles held athletic contests to honor his fallen comrade Patroclus and awarded prizes or <emphasis effect="italics">athla</emphasis> (from which the word “athlete” is derived).

Women were forbidden from watching and, if they dared to attend, could pay with their lives. Competitors were likely locals with proven abilities, though over time professional athletes came to dominate the sport. They could earn a good living from prizes and other rewards gained through their talent and celebrity, and their statues adorned the sanctuary at Olympia. The poet <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Pindar</term> in the early fifth century BCE was renowned for composing songs to honor them when they returned home as victors.

    <para id="para-00010">The start of the Archaic period also witnessed the reemergence of specialization in Greek society. Greek artists became more sophisticated and skilled in their work. They often copied artistic styles from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Egypt</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Phoenicia</term>, where Greek merchants were engaging in long-distance trade. At the site of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Al-Mina</term>, along the Mediterranean coast in Syria where historians believe the Phoenician <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">alphabet</term> was first transmitted to the Greeks, Greek and Phoenician merchants exchanged goods. Far to the west, on the island of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Ischia</term> off the west coast of Italy, Greeks were competing with Phoenician merchants for trade with local peoples, whose iron ore was in strong demand. Thanks to their contact and trade with the Phoenicians, Greeks adapted the Phoenician alphabet to their own language, making an important innovation by adding vowels (a, e, i, o, u). The eighth century BCE thus witnessed the return of literacy and the end of the Aegean world’s relative isolation after the interlude of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">Greek Dark Ages</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">The eighth century BCE was also the period in which the epic poems the <emphasis effect="italics">Iliad</emphasis> and the <emphasis effect="italics">Odyssey</emphasis> were composed, traditionally attributed to the blind poet <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Homer</term>. While historians debate whether Homer was a historical or a legendary figure, they agree the epics originated in the songs of oral poets in the Greek Dark Ages. In the eighth century BCE, using the Greek alphabet, scribes wrote these stories down for the first time.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">As the population expanded during the Archaic period, a shortage of farmland brought dramatic changes. Many Greeks in search of land to farm left their homes and founded colonies along the shores of the Black Sea and the northern Aegean, in North Africa at <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Cyrene</term> in Libya, and in southern Gaul (modern France) at <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Massalia</term> (Marseille). The largest number were on the island of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Sicily</term> and in southern Italy, the region the Greeks referred to as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Magna Graecia</term> or “Greater Greece.” When Greeks established a colony, it became an independent <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">polis</term> with its own laws. The free adult males of the community divided the colony’s land into equal lots. Thus, a new idea developed in the colonies that citizenship in a community was associated with equality and participation in the governing of the state.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">In the society of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Archaic Greece</term>, the elite landowners, or <emphasis effect="italics">aristoi</emphasis>, traditionally controlled the government and the priesthoods in the city-states. But thanks to the new ideas from the colonies, the common people, or <emphasis effect="italics">kakoi</emphasis>, began demanding land and a voice in the governing of the polis. They were able to gain leverage in these negotiations because <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">city-state</term>s needed troops in their wars for control of farmland. The nobility relied on the wealthier commoners, who could afford to equip themselves with iron weapons and armor. In some city-states, the <emphasis effect="italics">aristoi</emphasis> and the <emphasis effect="italics">kakoi</emphasis> were not able to resolve their differences peaceably. In such cases, a man who had strong popular support in the city would seize power and rule over the city. The Greeks referred to such populist leaders as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">tyrant</term>s.</para>
    <para id="para-00014">In the sixth century BCE, the difficulties caused by the land shortage were relieved by the invention of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">coinage</term>. A century before, adopting a practice of the kings of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">Lydia</term> in western Asia Minor (Turkey), Athens stamped silver pieces with the image of an owl, a symbol of wisdom often associated with the goddess <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">Athena</term> (See <link target-id="fig-00003"/>). Instead of weighing precious metals to use as currency or arguing over the value of bartered goods to trade, merchants could use coins as a simple medium of exchange. The <emphasis effect="italics">agora</emphasis>, or place of assembly in each city-state, thus became a marketplace to buy and sell goods. In the sixth century BCE, this rise of a market economy stimulated economic growth as farmers, artisans, and merchants discovered stronger incentives to produce and procure more goods for profit. For example, farmers learned how to produce more food with the land they already possessed rather than always seeking more land. The economic growth of this period is reflected in the many new temples the Greek city-states constructed then.</para>

    <title>Sparta and Athens</title>
    <para id="para-00015">In the Archaic period, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">Athens</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">Sparta</term> emerged as two of the most important of the many Greek city-states. Not only did their governments and cultures dominate the Greek world in the subsequent Classical period; they also fired the imaginations of Western cultures for centuries to come. Athens was the birthplace of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">democracy</term>, whereas Sparta was an oligarchy headed by two kings.</para>
    <section id="sect-00004">
    <title>The Rise and Organization of Sparta</title>
    <para id="para-00016">Sparta in the eighth century BCE was a collection of five villages in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">Laconia</term>, a mountain valley in the Peloponnese in southern Greece. Due to the shortage of farmland, the citizens (adult males) of these villages, the <emphasis effect="italics">Spartiates</emphasis>, all served in the military and waged war on neighboring towns, forcing them to pay tribute. The Spartiates also appropriated farmland for themselves and enslaved the inhabitants of these lands, most famously the Messenians, who became known as the <emphasis effect="italics">helots.</emphasis> Just as Greek colonists at this time divided land among themselves into equal lots, the Spartiates likewise divided the conquered land equally and assigned to each landowner a certain number of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">helot</term> families to work it. Helots, unlike enslaved people in other parts of Greece, could not be bought or sold but remained on the land as forced laborers from generation to generation. In the seventh century BCE, Sparta conquered the land of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">Messene</term> to its west and divided its farmland equally among the Spartiates.</para>
    <para id="para-00017">By the late sixth century BCE, the wealth from the rich agricultural land that Sparta then controlled had made it the most powerful state in the Peloponnese. Sparta also organized the city-states of this region and parts beyond into a system of alliances that historians refer to as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">Peloponnesian League</term>. Its members still had self-government and paid no tribute to Sparta, but all were expected to have the same friends and enemies as Sparta, which maintained its dominance in the league. Sparta also used its army to overthrow tyrants in the Peloponnesian city-states and restore political power to the <emphasis effect="italics">aristoi</emphasis>.</para>
    <para id="para-00018">The Spartans were proud of their unique system of government, or constitution, which was a set of laws and traditional political practices rather than a single document. It was said to have been created by a great lawgiver named <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">Lycurgus</term> around 800 BCE, but modern historians view its development as an evolutionary process during the Archaic period rather than the work of a single person.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">Sparta had two hereditary kings drawn from rival royal families. Their powers were very limited, though both sat as permanent members of the Council of Elders and were priests in the state religion. On occasion, the Spartan kings also led armies into battle. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">Assembly of Spartiates</term> passed all laws and approved all treaties with the advice of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">Council of Elders</term>. This Assembly also elected five judges every year who administered the affairs of state, as well as the members of the Council of Elders.</para>
    <para id="para-00020">The unique element of Spartan culture was the <emphasis effect="italics">agoge</emphasis>, its educational system. At the age of seven, boys were separated from their families and raised by the state. To teach them to live by their wits and courage, they were fed very little so they had to learn how to steal food to survive. At the age of twelve they began an even more severe regimen. They were not allowed clothes except a cloak in the wintertime, and they bathed just once a year (<link target-id="fig-00004"/>). They also underwent ritual beatings intended to make them physically strong and hardened warriors. At the age of eighteen, young men began two years of intense military training. At the age of twenty, a young Spartan man’s education was complete.</para>

    <para id="para-00021">Women of the Spartiate class, before marrying in their mid-teens, also practiced a strict physical regimen, since they were expected to be as strong as their male relatives and husbands and even participate in defending the homeland. Spartan women enjoyed a reputation for independence, since they managed the farms while men were constantly training for or at war and often ran their family estates alone due to the early deaths of their soldier husbands. The state organized unmarried women into teams known as <emphasis effect="italics">chorai</emphasis> (from which the term <emphasis effect="italics">chorus</emphasis> is derived) that danced and sang at religious festivals.</para>
    <para id="para-00022">When a Spartiate man reached the age of thirty, he could marry, vote in the Assembly, and serve as a judge. Each Spartiate remained in the army reserve until the age of sixty, when he could finally retire from military service and became eligible for election to the Council of Elders. Spartan citizens were proud to devote their time to the service of the state in the military and government; they did not have to work the land or learn a trade since this work was done for them by commoners and helot subjects.</para>

    <title>The Rise and Organization of Athens</title>
    <para id="para-00023"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">Athens</term>, like Sparta, developed its own system of government in the Archaic period. Uniquely large among Greek city-states, Athens had long enclosed all the land of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">Attica</term>, which included several mountain valleys. It was able to eventually develop into a militarily powerful democratic state in which all adult male citizens could participate in government, though “citizenship” was a restricted concept, and because only males could participate, it was by nature a limited <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">democracy</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00024">The roots of Athenian democracy are long and deep, however, and its democratic institutions evolved over centuries before reaching their fullest expression in the fifth century BCE. It was likely the growing prosperity of Athenians in the eighth century that had set Athens on this path. As more families became prosperous, they demanded greater say in the functioning of the city-state. By the seventh century BCE, Athens had an assembly allowing citizens (free adult males) to gather and discuss the affairs of the state. However, as the rising prosperity of Athenians stalled and economic hardship loomed by the end of the century, the durability of the fledgling democracy seemed in doubt. Attempts to solve the economic problems by adjusting the legal code, most notably by the legislator <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">Draco</term> (from whose name we get the modern term “draconian”), had little effect, though codifying the law in written form brought more clarity to the legal system.</para>
    <para id="para-00025">With the once-thriving middle class slipping into bankruptcy and sometimes slavery, civil war seemed inevitable. Disaster was avoided only with the appointment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">Solon</term> in 594 BCE to restore order. Solon came from a wealthy elite family, but he made it known that he would draft laws to benefit all Athenians, rich and poor. A poet, he used his songs to convey his ideas for these new laws (<link target-id="fig-00005"/>).</para>

    <para id="para-00026">One of Solon’s first measures was to declare that all debts Athenians owed one another were forgiven. Solon also made it law that no Athenian could be sold into slavery for failure to repay a loan. These decrees did much to provide relief to farmers struggling with debt who could now return to work the land. Under Solon’s new laws, each of Athens’s four traditional tribes chose one hundred of its members by lot, including commoners, to sit in the new <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">Council of Four Hundred</term> and run the government. There were still magistrates, but now Solon created the jury courts. All Athenians could appeal the ruling of a magistrate in court and have their cases heard by a jury of fellow citizens. Solon also set up a hierarchal system in which citizens were eligible for positions in government based on wealth instead of hereditary privilege. Wealth was measured by the amount of grain and olive oil a citizen’s land could produce. Only the wealthiest could serve as a magistrate, sit on the Council, and attend the Assembly and jury courts. Citizens with less wealth could participate in all these activities but could not serve as magistrates. The poorest could only attend the Assembly and the jury courts.</para>
    <para id="para-00027">Solon’s reforms were not enough to end civil unrest, however. By 545 BCE, a relative of his named <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">Pisistratus</term> had seized power by force with his own private army and ruled as a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">tyrant</term> with broad popular support. Pisistratus was reportedly a benevolent despot and very popular. He kept Solon’s reforms largely in place, and Athenians became accustomed to serving in Solon’s Council and in jury courts. They were actively engaged in self-government, thus setting the stage for the establishment of democracy. Pisistratus also encouraged the celebration of religious festivals and cults that united the people of Attica through a common religion. To further help the farmers Solon brought back, Pisistratus redistributed land so they could once again make a living.</para>
    <para id="para-00028">After Pisistratus’s death, his sons tried to carry on as tyrants, but they lacked their father’s popularity. Around 509 BCE, an Athenian aristocrat named <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">Cleisthenes</term> persuaded the Spartans to intervene in Athens and overthrow these tyrants. The Spartans, however, set up a government of elites in Athens that did not include Cleisthenes. Consequently, he appealed to the common people living in the villages, or <emphasis effect="italics">demes</emphasis>, to reject this pro-Spartan regime and establish a “<emphasis effect="italics">demo</emphasis>cracy.” His appeal was successful, and Cleisthenes implemented reforms to Solon’s system of government. He replaced the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">Council of Four Hundred</term> with one of five hundred and reorganized the Athenians into ten new tribes, including in each one villages from different parts of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">Attica</term>. Every year, each tribe chose fifty members by lot to sit in the new Council. This reform served to unite the Athenians, since each tribe consisted of people from different parts of Attica who now had to work together politically. Each tribe’s delegation of fifty also served as presidents for part of the year and ran the day-to-day operation of the government.</para>
    <para id="para-00029">By the end of the Archaic period, Athens had developed a functioning direct <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">democracy</term>, which differs from modern republics in which citizens vote for representatives who sit in the legislature. All citizens could sit in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061">Athenian Assembly</term>, which then was required to meet at least ten times a year. All laws had to be approved by the Assembly. Only the Assembly could declare war and approve treaties. Athens had a citizen body of thirty to forty thousand adult males in the Classical period, but only six thousand needed to convene for meetings of the Assembly. Citizens could also be chosen by lot to sit in the Council. Since they were permitted to serve for just two one-year terms over a lifetime, many Athenians had the opportunity to participate in the executive branch of government. All citizens also served on juries, which not only determined the guilt or innocence of the accused but also interpreted the way the law was applied. Women, enslaved people, and foreign residents could not participate. However, women of the citizen class were prominent in the public religious life of the city, serving as priestesses and in ceremonial roles in religious festivals.</para>

These Persian forces landed at <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00073">Marathon</term> on the west coast of Attica.

    <para id="para-00036">After the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00083">Persian Wars</term>, the Athenians took the lead in continuing the fight against Persia and liberating all Greek city-states. In 477 BCE, they organized an alliance of Greek city-states known today as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00084">Delian League</term>, headquartered on the Aegean island of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00085">Delos</term>. Members could provide ships and troops for the league or simply pay Athens to equip the fleet, which most chose to do. Over the next several decades, allied forces of the Delian League liberated the Greek city-states of Ionia from Persian rule and supported rebellions against Persia in Cyprus and Egypt. Around 449 BCE, Athens and Persia reached a peace settlement in which the Persians recognized the independence of Ionia and the Athenians agreed to stop aiding rebels in the Persian Empire.</para>
    <para id="para-00037">Over the course of this war, the money from the Delian League enriched many lower-class Athenians, who found employment as rowers in the fleet. Athens even began paying jurors in jury courts and people who attended meetings of the Assembly. Over time it became clear to the other Greeks that the Delian League was no longer an alliance but an empire in which the subject city-states paid a steady flow of tribute. In 465 BCE, the city-state of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00086">Thasos</term> withdrew from the league but was compelled by Athenian forces to rejoin. Around 437 BCE, the Athenians began using tribute to rebuild the temples on the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00087">Acropolis</term> that the Persians had destroyed. Including the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00088">Parthenon</term>, dedicated to Athena Parthenos, these were some of the most beautiful temples ever built and the pride of Athens, but to the subject city-states they came to symbolize Athenians’ despotism and arrogance (See <link target-id="fig-00007"/>).</para>

    <para id="para-00041">Several years later, arguing that the empire could thrive only by expanding, an ambitious young Athenian politician named <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00094">Alcibiades</term> (a kinsman of Pericles) inspired a massive invasion of Sicily targeting <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00095">Syracuse</term>, the island’s largest city-state. Just as the campaign began in 415 BCE, Alcibiades’s political enemies in Athens accused him of impiety and treason, and he fled to Sparta to avoid a trial. Without his leadership, the expedition against Syracuse floundered, and in 413 BCE the entire Athenian force was destroyed. In exile, Alcibiades convinced the Spartans to invade Attica again, now that Athens had been weakened by the disaster in Syracuse. In the years that followed, the Spartans realized they needed a large fleet to defeat Athens, and they secured funds for it from Persia on the condition that Sparta restore the Greek cities in Ionia to Persian rule. In 405 BCE, the new Spartan fleet destroyed the Athenian navy at the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00096">Battle of Aegospotami</term> in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00097">Hellespont</term>.

    <para id="para-00042">The conclusion of the Peloponnesian War initially left Sparta dominant in Greece. Immediately following the war, Sparta established oligarchies of local aristocrats in the city-states that had been democracies under the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00099">Delian League</term>. And it set up the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00100">Era of the Thirty Tyrants</term>, a brief rule of oligarchs in Athens. With regard to Persia, Sparta reneged on its promise to restore the Greek city-states in Ionia to Persian control. Persia responded by funding Greek resistance to Sparta, which eventually compelled Sparta to accept Persia’s terms in exchange for Persian support. This meant turning over the Ionian city-states as it had previously promised.</para>
    <para id="para-00043">Now with Persian backing, the Spartans continued to interfere in the affairs of other Greek city-states. This angered city-states like Thebes and Athens.

    <title>The Classical “Golden Age”</title>
    <para id="para-00044">Many historians view the Greek Classical period and the cultural achievements in Athens in particular as a “Golden Age” of art, literature, and philosophy. Some scholars argue that this period saw the birth of science and philosophy because for the first time people critically examined the natural world and subjected religious beliefs to reason. (Other modern historians argue that this position discounts the accomplishments in medicine and mathematics of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.) For example, around 480 BCE, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00107">Empedocles</term> speculated that the universe was not created by gods but instead was the result of the four material “elements”—air, water, fire, earth—being subjected to the forces of attraction and repulsion. Another philosopher and scientist of the era, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00108">Democritus</term>, maintained that the universe consisted of tiny particles he called “atoms” that came together randomly in a vortex to form the universe.</para>
    <para id="para-00045">Philosophers questioned not only the traditional views of the gods but also traditional values. Some of this questioning came from the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00109">sophists</term> (“wise ones”) of Athens, those with a reputation for learning, wisdom, and skillful deployment of rhetoric. Sophists emerged as an important presence in the democratic world of Athens beginning in the mid-fourth century BCE. They claimed to be able to teach anyone <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00110">rhetoric</term>, or the art of persuasion, for a fee, as a means to achieve success as a lawyer or a politician. While many ambitious men sought the services of sophists, others worried that speakers thus trained could lead the people to act against their own self-interest.</para>
    <para id="para-00046">Many thought <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00111">Socrates</term> was one of the sophists. A stonecutter by trade, Socrates publicly questioned sophists and politicians about good and evil, right and wrong. He wanted to base values on reason instead of on unchallenged traditional beliefs. His questioning often embarrassed powerful people in Athens and made enemies, while his disciples included the politician <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00112">Alcibiades</term> and even some who had opposed Athenian democracy.

    <media alt="Two marble statues are shown. The (a) off-white statue on the left is of a naked man bending down at the waist with his left foot behind him. His right knee is bent a bit, he is hunched over, his left arm rests near his right knee. He holds a flat circular object in his right hand behind his back. He is looking down and has short hair, large eyes and his mouth is turned down. The statue rests on a white and gray marbled pedestal and the wall behind the statue is yellow and brown marbled on the left and white and gray marbled on the right. (b) The yellowish statue stands on a rectangular stone pedestal on a solid dark black background. The statue is a naked man with his right arm cut off just above the elbow. He has short curly hair and wears strappy sandals. In his left arm he holds a very small child with arms cut off and curly hair and robes that drape to the ground.">

    <caption>In the mid-fifth century BCE, the Greek sculptor Myron produced a lifelike bronze statue of an athlete throwing a discus. Here (a) is a Roman marble copy of his statue. Approximately one century later, the Greek sculptor Praxiteles produced a similarly realistic statue (b), possibly depicting the Greek god Hermes holding Dionysus as a baby.

    <media alt="Two images of a bowl and jug are shown. The (a) faded silver bowl is round and shown standing up on a gray background. The outer perimeter is not smooth and shows small circles all around the bowl. Repetitive designs of leaves and people run on the outer circle. The next inner circle repeats designs of animals, leaves, and fowl. The final inner circle shows two figures facing each other. Small circles of tiny dots separate the three rings. (b) An image of a jug is shown on a flat gray surface with a gray background. The jug is fluted at the top with a short black neck. The bottom of the jug is pear shaped and has four rows of scenes depicted on a beige background and six-petaled black flowers strewn in the first two rows. Brown, red, and black stripes separate the rows of scenes. The top row shows two winged creatures with four paws each and a human looking head with long curly black hair. The wings show multi-colored feathers in black and brown and a long thin tail is seen at their hind ends. The next row shows large black animals with four legs and brown manes and underbellies with long snouts and large ears – two in the middle facing each other and two more at each end only showing their raised heads. The next row shows two long, thin, black animals with four paws, tails, and brown necks facing to the left and one with long ears and a bit smaller in front of them at the left. The last row shows a beige background with black lines.">

    <media alt="A picture of an ancient cup and a jug are shown. (a) An image of a black and orange cup on its side with the bottom facing forward is shown. The bottom of the cup has orange and black circles and sticks out the bottom of the cup. The outside of the cup is black with an orange scene depicted twice – two horses pulling a standing chariot with a rider holding the reins. In between are designs depicting leaf-like drawings. Two handles are shown, one on each side. (b) A tall black jug is shown with orange drawings on the top. The top is a circular orange-lipped opening with a thicker middle with two orange handles and a thinner tall base. The larger part shows an orange drawing of two figures – both in long cloths and barefoot with muscular legs. The figure on the left holds a cone shaped object in their left hand and the figure on the right appears to be running away. Repetitive circular resigns run along both sides of the drawing and long leafy vines are shown around the figures.">

    <para id="para-00058">During the Archaic period that began the Greek renaissance, the city-state, or polis, developed its defining characteristic—self-government. Sparta was an oligarchy whose elite class of soldier-citizens alone participated in government, while Athens developed a democracy in which all adult male citizens participated. During this period, well-known features of Greek culture emerged such as the Greek script, the epic poems of Homer, and the Olympic Games.</para>
    <para id="para-00059">The Classical period of Greece was marked by increased creativity and innovation, especially in Athens. The philosophical schools of Plato and Aristotle, the histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, the plays of Athenian dramatists, and the art of Greek sculptors, architects, and painters have inspired European thinkers and artists for centuries. These developments were partially a result of the success the Greek city-states achieved in their efforts to withstand two invasions by the Persian Empire. Following these wars, however, the Greek city-states turned on themselves. Sparta and its allies first fought the Athenian empire in the Peloponnesian War. Following this long and destructive conflict, Sparta and Thebes struggled for dominance in Greece, often with meddling from the Persian Empire. By 350 BCE, the many decades of fighting had left the Greek city-states exhausted and vulnerable.</para>
