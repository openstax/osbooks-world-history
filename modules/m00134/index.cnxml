    <para>The Classical period in Greece ended when <term class="no-emphasis">Greece</term> lost its freedom to the Kingdom of Macedon and Macedon&#8217;s king Alexander the Great conquered the <term class="no-emphasis">Persian Empire</term>. The period that followed Alexander&#8217;s death is known as the <term class="no-emphasis">Hellenistic period</term> (323&#8211;31 BCE). Alexander&#8217;s empire was divided among his top generals, including <term class="no-emphasis">Seleucus</term>, <term class="no-emphasis">Ptolemy</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis">Antigonus</term>. During this time, Greeks, also called Hellenes, ruled over and interacted with the populations of the former Persian Empire. The resulting mixture of cultures was neither Greek nor non-Greek but &#8220;Greek-like,&#8221; or <term>Hellenistic</term>, a term that refers to the flourishing and expansion of Greek language and culture throughout the Mediterranean and Near East during this period.</para>
    <section>
    <title>The Kingdom of Macedon</title>
    <para>The ancient <term class="no-emphasis">Kingdom of Macedon</term> straddled today&#8217;s Greece and northern <term class="no-emphasis">Macedonia</term>. The Macedonians did not speak Greek but had adopted Greek culture in the Archaic period, and their royal family claimed to be descended from the mythical Greek hero <term class="no-emphasis">Heracles</term>.</para>
    <para>King <term class="no-emphasis">Philip II</term> of Macedon, who reigned from 359 to 336 BCE, transformed the kingdom into a great power. He recruited common farmers and developed them into a formidable infantry, with trained aristocrats as cavalry. His tactical skills and diplomacy allowed Philip to secure control of new territory in <term class="no-emphasis">Thrace</term> (modern-day northern Greece and Bulgaria), which provided access to precious metals and thus the economic resources to expand his military power.</para>
    <para>In 338 BCE, <term class="no-emphasis">Athens</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">Thebes</term> finally put decades of conflict aside to ally against the rising power of Macedon. At the <term class="no-emphasis">Battle of Chaeronea</term> (338 BCE), the Macedonians crushed this allied army. Philip sought to unite the Greek city-states under his leadership after this victory, and he organized them toward the goal of waging war against the Persian Empire. However, in 336 BCE, Philip was killed by an assassin with a personal grudge.</para>
    <para>Philip II was succeeded by his twenty-year-old son Alexander III, later known as Alexander the Great, who immediately faced an invasion by Thracian tribes from the north and a rebellion in Greece led by Thebes and Athens. Within a year, the young king had crushed these opponents and announced he was carrying out his father&#8217;s plan to wage war against Persia. <term class="no-emphasis">Darius III</term>, the Persian king, amassed armies to face him, but they were mainly draftees from the subject peoples of the Persian Empire. At the battles of Issus (333 BCE) and Gaugamela (330 BCE), these forces collapsed against the Macedonians, commanded by Alexander himself.</para>
    <para>At first, Alexander envisioned his campaign as a war of vengeance against Persia. Although he was Macedonian, he saw himself as a Hellene and often compared himself to the hero Achilles of the <emphasis effect="italics">Iliad</emphasis>, from whom he claimed to be descended through his mother. In 330 BCE, Alexander&#8217;s forces sacked and later burned Persepolis, the jewel of the Persian Empire. After the assassination of Darius III by disgruntled Persian nobles that same year, however, Alexander claimed the Persian throne and introduced Persian customs to his court, such as having his subjects prostrate themselves before him. To consolidate his control of the Persian Empire, in 330&#8211;326 BCE he advanced his army deep into central Asia and to the Indus River valley (modern Pakistan) (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). In 326 BCE, his exhausted troops mutinied and refused to advance to the <term class="no-emphasis">Ganges River</term> in central India as Alexander desired. He led his army back to <term class="no-emphasis">Babylon</term> in Mesopotamia, where he died in 323 BCE at the age of thirty-three, probably due to the cumulative impact of injuries experienced during the campaign.</para>

    <title>Why Did Alexander Burn <term class="no-emphasis">Persepolis</term>?</title>
    <para>When Alexander reached Persepolis after the Battle of Gaugamela, he saw what was possibly the most beautiful city in the entire Persian Empire. Over the centuries Darius, Xerxes, and others had adorned it with colorful palaces, public buildings, and artwork. Within a few months of his arrival, however, Alexander had reduced the once-stunning imperial city to ashes and ruins. Why?</para>
    <para>Historians have pondered this question for thousands of years. Though there are several accounts, the earliest was penned centuries after the actual events. The most common explanation cites a long night of drunken revels and a Greek woman named <term class="no-emphasis">Tha&#239;s</term> (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). This account is by the first-century BCE Greek historian Diodorus <term class="no-emphasis">Siculus</term>:</para>
    <quote><para>Alexander held games to celebrate his victories; he offered magnificent sacrifices to the gods and entertained his friends lavishly. One day when the Companions [fellow cavalry soldiers] were feasting, and intoxication was growing as the drinking went on, a violent madness took hold of these drunken men. One of the women present [Tha&#239;s] declared that it would be Alexander&#8217;s greatest achievement in Asia to join in their procession and set fire to the royal palace, allowing women&#8217;s hands to destroy in an instant what had been the pride of the Persians.</para>

    <title>Tha&#239;s Burns Persepolis.</title>
    <media alt="An image of a richly colorful painting is shown. In the middle of the image a figure in short red robes and red sandals stands on the top step of a staircase and holds up a woman in a pink draped cloth around her waist. Bare chested, she is raising her arms up and her right hand holds a long brown stick with red and yellow fire blazing at the top. Fire burns behind her in front of a tall white-columned structure. People can be seen behind her and the fire holding up their arms in the air and holding sticks with fire as well. In the background mountains can be seen and a bluish-green sky. In the left foreground a blue and pale green mosaic tile wall is seen with the image of a four-legged animal. Atop the wall is a round column in a dark blue with people clamoring around it with their arms raised wearing long robes. In the bottom left-hand corner, two people in short robes and flowers in their hair run to the left with a stick of fire in one raised hand. In the right corner of the image a group of figures, some in long robes, some in waistcloths, and one naked woman, are seen looking at the two figures at the top of the steps. Their arms are raised to them. Across the bottom of the image is a richly decorated red rug with a large vase of flowers in all shapes of red and pink. Two figures lay at the left of the rug, one with their arm raised toward the middle.">

    </figure>
    <para>Later Roman historians such as <term class="no-emphasis">Quintus Curtius Rufus</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">Plutarch</term> provide similar accounts, saying the fire was the result of an out-of-control party and lit at Tha&#239;s&#8217;s insistence. But at least one ancient writer disagrees. Relying on sources from <term class="no-emphasis">Ptolemy</term> and other contemporaries of Alexander, the historian <term class="no-emphasis">Arrian of Nicomedia</term> makes no mention of Tha&#239;s or a night of heavy drinking. He says the destruction of the city was intentional, the product of calculated revenge &#8220;for their invasion of Greece...for the destruction of Athens, the burning of the temples, and all the other crimes they had committed against the Greeks.&#8221;</para>
    <para>What really happened at Persepolis? Was Tha&#239;s the instigator or merely the scapegoat? Thousands of years later we may be able only to speculate about the cause of this catastrophic event.</para>
    <list class="critical-thinking">
    <item>Given what you&#8217;ve read, who do you think was responsible for the burning of Persepolis? Why?</item>
    <item>If Tha&#239;s wasn&#8217;t responsible, why do you think some ancient historians were convinced of her culpability?</item>

    <para>Though his Bactrian wife <term class="no-emphasis">Roxane</term> was pregnant when he died, Alexander had made no arrangements for a successor. Members of his court and his military commanders thus fought among themselves for control of the empire in what historians refer to as the <term class="no-emphasis">Wars of the Successors</term>. One of the more colorful contestants was <term class="no-emphasis">Pyrrhus</term>, who was not Macedonian but was the king of Epirus and Alexander&#8217;s cousin. Pyrrhus temporarily seized the throne of Macedon and attempted to carve out an empire for himself in Sicily and southern Italy. He never lost a battle, but he lost so many troops in a campaign defending Magna Graecia in southern Italy from Rome that he was never able to capitalize on his success. (Today the term <emphasis effect="italics">pyrrhic victory</emphasis> refers to a win so costly that it is in effect a loss.) In 272 BCE, Pyrrhus died after being struck by a roof tile thrown at him by an elderly woman during a street battle in the city of <term class="no-emphasis">Argos</term>. His death marked the end of the wars among Alexander&#8217;s generals.</para>
    <para>By the middle of the third century BCE, certain generals and their descendants were ruling as kings over different portions of Alexander&#8217;s empire (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>). Antigonus and his descendants, the <term class="no-emphasis">Antigonids</term>, ruled Macedon and much of Greece. Some <term class="no-emphasis">city-state</term>s in Greece organized federal leagues to maintain their independence from Macedon. The <term class="no-emphasis">Achaean League</term> was in the Peloponnese and the Aetolian League in central Greece. Another Macedonian general, <term class="no-emphasis">Ptolemy</term>, was king of Egypt. To win the support of the Egyptian people, Ptolemy and his successors assumed the title of pharaoh and built temples to Egyptian gods. Yet another Macedonian general, Seleucus and his descendants, the <term class="no-emphasis">Seleucids</term>, ruled as kings over much of the former Persian Empire, from Asia Minor in the west to central Asia in the east. They adopted many practices of the Persian Empire, including honoring local gods, as revealed by cuneiform records of the offerings they made.</para>

    <para>The <term class="no-emphasis">Seleucid Kingdom</term> was an enormous and complicated region, stretching from the Aegean Sea to today&#8217;s Afghanistan, with a population of some thirty million people of various ethnic and linguistic groups. Keeping control over the vast kingdom proved difficult, and some of the far eastern portions like Bactria and Parthia began to break away around 250 BCE. Both became separate <term class="no-emphasis">Hellenistic</term> kingdoms, ruled initially by former Greek governors of the areas. Around 200 BCE, the <term class="no-emphasis">Bactrian kingdom</term> invaded and conquered the Indus River valley. The most famous of the Bactrian kings of India was <term class="no-emphasis">Menander I</term>, whose kingdom stretched from the Indus River valley to the upper Ganges in central India. Menander converted to <term class="no-emphasis">Buddhism</term> and became a holy man, known in India as <term class="no-emphasis">Milinda</term>. The Greek colonists who settled in Bactria and India introduced their art into the region, which influenced Indian sculpture, painting, and architecture. By the end of the second century BCE, however, the Bactrian kingdom had collapsed due to constant civil wars between rival claimants to the throne. We know of their existence only through the coins they issued as kings (<link target-id="fig-00004"/>).</para>

    <para>In these Hellenistic kingdoms, where peace treaties and alliances could be secured through arranged marriages, elite women might achieve political power unimaginable in Classical Greece. In Egypt, for example, <term class="no-emphasis">Ptolemy II</term> married his sister <term class="no-emphasis">Arsinoe</term>, as was the custom for pharaohs, and installed her as co-ruler. Dynastic queens also often ruled when the designated heir was just a child. In 253 BCE, the Seleucid king <term class="no-emphasis">Antiochus II</term> ended his war for control of Syria with a treaty by which he married <term class="no-emphasis">Bernice</term>, the daughter of his opponent Ptolemy II. However, Antiochus&#8217;s former wife <term class="no-emphasis">Laodice</term> murdered Berenice and her children upon Antiochus&#8217;s death in 246 BCE to secure the succession for her own young son <term class="no-emphasis">Seleucus II</term>. Ptolemy III subsequently declared war to avenge the death of his sister and her children.</para>
    <para>In 194 BCE, <term class="no-emphasis">Antiochus III</term> ended yet another war for control of Syria by giving his daughter <term class="no-emphasis">Cleopatra I</term> in marriage to <term class="no-emphasis">Ptolemy V</term>. Upon Ptolemy&#8217;s death in 180 BCE, Cleopatra ruled because their sons and daughter were still children. The most famous of the powerful Hellenistic queens was this Cleopatra&#8217;s descendant, <term class="no-emphasis">Cleopatra VII</term>, who reigned from 51 to 31 BCE. The last of the Ptolemies, Cleopatra VII reigned as co-ruler with her brothers <term class="no-emphasis">Ptolemy XIII</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">Ptolemy XIV</term>, as well as with <term class="no-emphasis">Ptolemy XV</term>, also called <term class="no-emphasis">Caesarion</term>, who was her son with the Roman general <term class="no-emphasis">Julius Caesar</term>.</para>

    <title>Hellenistic Culture</title>
    <para>A characteristic cultural feature of the Hellenistic period was the blending of Greek and other cultures of the former <term class="no-emphasis">Persian Empire</term>. The Seleucid and Ptolemaic dynasties both employed Greeks and Macedonians as soldiers and bureaucrats in their empires. <term class="no-emphasis">Alexander the Great</term> and subsequent Hellenistic kings founded Greek cities in the former Persian Empire for Greek and Macedonian colonists, often naming them in honor of themselves or their queens. These cities included the institutions of the Greek cities of their homeland&#8212;temples to Greek gods, theaters, <emphasis effect="italics">agora</emphasis> (marketplaces), and gymnasia&#8212;so the colonists could feel at home in their new environment. At the site of <term class="no-emphasis">Ai Khanum</term> in modern Afghanistan, archaeologists have uncovered the impressive remains of one such Hellenistic city with a gymnasium.</para>
    <para><term class="no-emphasis">Alexandria</term> in Egypt, founded by Alexander himself in 331 BCE, was the capital of the Ptolemaic kingdom and the largest Hellenistic city, with a population that reached one million. There the Ptolemies founded the <emphasis effect="italics">Museon</emphasis>, or &#8220;home of the Muses,&#8221; from which the term &#8220;museum&#8221; derives. They modeled this on Aristotle&#8217;s <term class="no-emphasis">Lyceum</term>, as a center for scientific research and literary studies. These same kings also patronized the <term class="no-emphasis">Alexandrian Library</term>, where they assembled the largest collection of books in the ancient world. <term class="no-emphasis">Antioch</term>, in today&#8217;s southeastern Turkey, was the largest city of the Seleucid kingdom, with a population of half a million. In cities such as Alexandria and Antioch, the Greek-speaking population became integrated with the indigenous population.</para>
    <para>Most Greek cities in this period were no longer independent since they were usually under the control of one of the Hellenistic kingdoms. The <term class="no-emphasis">city-state</term>s of the Achaean and Aetolian Leagues in Greece were the exception, fiercely maintaining their independence against the Antigonid rulers of Macedon. Having lost the right of self-government, many Greeks in cities under the rule of kings no longer focused on politics and diplomacy but turned to the search for personal happiness. New religions emerged that promised earthly contentment and eternal life and combined Greek and non-Greek elements. For example, the worship of the Egyptian goddess Isis became common in many Hellenistic cities.</para>
    <para>Mithras was a Persian sun god worshiped by the Medes, but in the second century BCE, Greeks in Hellenistic cities came to believe <term class="no-emphasis">Mithras</term> would lead them, too, to eternal life. His followers built special chapels decorated with symbols whose meaning is still disputed. The emphasis on secret religious rituals, or <emphasis effect="italics">mysteries</emphasis>, about which followers were sworn to silence, lends the worship of Isis and Mithras in this period the name <term>mystery religions</term> (<link target-id="fig-00005"/>).</para>

    <para>Another religion practiced in <term class="no-emphasis">Hellenistic</term> cities was <term class="no-emphasis">Judaism</term>, whose followers included migrant Jewish people and new converts. By the second century BCE, the Hebrew Bible had been translated into Greek under the Ptolemies, since ancient Judea was within their control for much of the Hellenistic period and many Jewish people had immigrated to Alexandria.</para>
    <para>Some Greeks preferred new philosophies to religion as a means to achieve happiness. Hellenistic philosophy emphasized the search for internal peace and contentment. <term class="no-emphasis">Stoicism</term>, for example, maintained that the universe was governed by divine reason (<emphasis effect="italics">Logos</emphasis>), which determined the fate of all people. Happiness therefore resulted from learning how to cope with life and accepting fate while avoiding extreme negative emotions such as fear and anger. <term class="no-emphasis">Epicureans</term>, however, maintained that the key to happiness was to avoid physical and mental pain by pursuing pleasure. The founders of these two philosophical schools, <term class="no-emphasis">Zeno</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">Epicurus</term> respectively, both lived in the early third century BCE and taught in <term class="no-emphasis">Athens</term>, which continued to be a center of learning in this period. The Stoics were so named because Zeno instructed his students in the <emphasis effect="italics">stoa poikile</emphasis>, or &#8220;painted porch&#8221; in the Athenian <emphasis effect="italics">agora</emphasis>. The <term class="no-emphasis">mystery religions</term> and philosophies of the Hellenistic era continued to flourish as these cities became incorporated into the expanding Roman Empire.</para>

    <para>By 338 BCE, King Philip II&#8217;s empire of Macedon had become the ruling power in Greece. Philip&#8217;s son Alexander the Great adopted his father&#8217;s plan to unite the Greek city-states in a war of revenge against the Persian Empire. He defeated the Persians at the battles of Issus (333 BCE) and Gaugamela (330 BCE), and after the assassination of the Persian king Darius III, he claimed the Persian throne for himself and advanced deep into central Asia and India. After his own soldiers mutinied, however, Alexander withdrew to Babylon, where he died in 323 BCE.</para>
    <para>Alexander&#8217;s generals and their children competed for control of his empire between 323 BCE and 272 BCE. The descendants of Alexander&#8217;s generals, Antigonus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy, ruled over separate kingdoms in Macedon and Greece, western and central Asia, and Egypt, building new Greek cities for their Greek colonists. Alexandria in Egypt, the largest Hellenistic city, was a center of Greek science and literature, with its massive library and museum. Having lost sovereignty and self-government, many Greeks sought personal happiness through new philosophies such as Epicureanism and Stoicism.</para>
