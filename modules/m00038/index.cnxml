    <para id="para-00002">At the beginning of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Cold War</term>, ideological differences between the Soviet Union and the United States seemed insurmountable. The enmity between the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc resulted in conflicts around the globe that cost the lives of millions of people. Millions also died in China’s pursuit of the ideal communist society. Nuclear weapons that threatened the very existence of the human species were stockpiled in preparation for a war that neither side wanted. A world that was not so deeply divided seemed unimaginable to many. However, the Cold War lasted less than fifty years.</para>

    <title>The Collapse of Communism: The Eastern Bloc</title>
    <para id="para-00003">The Cold War had begun in Greece, an unlikely place. Its last shot was also fired in an unlikely place—<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Afghanistan</term>, the site of the final proxy war waged between the allies of the Soviet Union and those of the United States.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">In 1973, the nationalist Mohammad Sardar <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Daoud</term> Khan, once the prime minister of Afghanistan from 1953 to 1963, came to power again in that country after deposing its king. He was originally backed by the communist <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)</term>, which received support from the Soviet Union. Not all factions of the PDPA supported Daoud, however. When he failed to reconcile the factions and realized he was losing the support of PDPA members who had helped him to power, he turned to the United States for support. He wished to free Afghanistan from dependence on the Soviet Union, which had extended assistance to the country in the past, and he reasoned that the United States would help. He also sought closer relations with U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Iran and expelled Soviet military and economic advisers from the country.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">In 1978, Daoud was overthrown and killed by one of the PDPA factions. As the victors sought to eliminate their enemies, a group of Islamic fundamentalists who opposed secular and Western influences on Islamic societies and endorsed strict codes of behavior fought back against government attempts to spread communism to tribal areas. When it became clear that the PDPA leader favored by Moscow could not maintain control of the country and a pro-U.S. rival was gaining ascendancy, the Soviet Union sent ground troops to invade Afghanistan in December 1979.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">President Jimmy <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Carter</term> protested the Soviet incursion and imposed economic sanctions. The United States also continued arming the Islamist enemies of the pro-Soviet Afghan regime, a policy it had been following for some time. These Islamist insurgents, called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010"><emphasis effect="italics">mujahideen</emphasis></term> (Arabic for Muslims who battle non-Muslims on behalf of Islam), regarded the Afghan government and the Soviet Union as enemies of religion and waged a guerrilla war against them. The Soviet Union fought the various groups of <emphasis effect="italics">mujahideen</emphasis> for ten years without coming close to victory. It spent the equivalent of billions of dollars and lost some fifteen thousand soldiers. About two million Afghans were killed.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">Among the groups of <emphasis effect="italics">mujahideen</emphasis> who fought the Soviets were young men from the Pashtun tribe who had studied at Islamic religious schools in Pakistan. They were supported by both the CIA and its Pakistani equivalent, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, and were called the Taliban (meaning “student” in the Pashtun tribal language of Pashto). Following the withdrawal of the Soviets, various groups of <emphasis effect="italics">mujahideen</emphasis> battled for control of Afghanistan, with the Taliban eventually emerging victorious. The stability and order their rule offered was welcomed by many Afghans after the long years of chaos.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">Although the United States offered the <emphasis effect="italics">mujahideen</emphasis> support to combat the Soviets in Afghanistan, it found itself the enemy of another group of Islamic fundamentalists, this time in Iran. Since the 1950s, the United States had provided funds and weapons to the leader of Iran, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. With U.S. aid, the Shah had built one of the largest armies in the Middle East and SAVAK, one of the most feared secret police forces. He allowed no dissent, and the secret police spied upon, arrested, and tortured anyone suspected of opposing him. The Shah’s efforts to modernize and Westernize Iran by granting women the right to vote, outlawing their wearing of veils, and providing them equal opportunities for education angered many traditionalist Muslim religious leaders. They also disliked the messages contained in the Western movies and music the Shah had allowed into <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Iran</term>. In contrast, although liberal Iranians approved of these actions, they disliked the lack of political freedom. Nearly all Iranians resented the enormous wealth the Shah and his closest friends had amassed as a result of U.S. assistance. The Shah had few supporters.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">One of his most outspoken critics was the Shiite religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Khomeini</term>. Despite being repeatedly arrested, Khomeini continued to criticize both the Shah and his patron, the U.S. government. In 1964, Khomeini was expelled from Iran. This did not end his influence, however, and tape-recorded messages from him encouraging opposition to the Shah were smuggled into the country. Beginning in 1977, Khomeini exhorted Iranians to go on strike and refuse to pay their taxes. In 1978, waves of protests and strikes by government and oil industry workers were punished with attacks by government forces. Each was followed by a larger wave of protest.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">On January 16, 1979, the Shah and his family fled the country, and two weeks later Ayatollah Khomeini returned. He was greeted enthusiastically by the vast majority of Iranians, and in mid-February 1979, Shapur Bakhtiar, the prime minister appointed by the Shah, was replaced by Mehdi Bazargan, selected by Khomeini. In December 1979, the Iranian people voted to adopt a constitution making the country an Islamic republic. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Islam</term> became the nation’s official religion, and the constitution ordained that all laws passed must conform to Islamic law.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">On October 22, 1979, the Shah entered the United States for medical treatment. Many Iranians feared this meant Washington was about to take steps to return him to power. On November 4, Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in the Iranian capital of Tehran and took its staff and Marine guards hostage, demanding the Shah be returned to Iran for trial and execution (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). Their actions were widely supported within Iran, including by Khomeini, which led the moderate prime minister to resign. Although female and African American hostages were released within a few days, the others were held for 444 days, to be set free on January 20, 1981, the day President Carter left office.</para>

    <para id="para-00012">Fearing that Iraqi <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Shiite</term>s would be radicalized by events in neighboring Iran, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Sunni</term>-dominated government of Iraq, controlled by the socialist Ba’ath Party, sent its troops to invade Iran. Iraq also hoped to resolve long-standing border disputes between the two nations and replace Iran as the dominant nation in the region, which had not been possible when Iran was receiving U.S. military and economic support. The United States provided economic and technological support to Iraq. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Iran-Iraq</term> war ended in August 1988 with a cease-fire arranged by the United Nations and no real gains by either side.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">Despite its support of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Iraq</term> in its war against Iran, the chief concern of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">United States</term> in the 1980s was not violence in the Middle East but the destruction of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">communism</term>. Jimmy Carter was followed in office by President Ronald <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Reagan</term>, who considered the Soviet Union an “evil empire” and vowed to eliminate communism. He believed the United States should negotiate with the Soviets to ensure world peace but should do so from a position of strength. To this end, he ordered a buildup of the country’s abilities to fight both a conventional and a nuclear war. His successor in office, George H.W. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Bush</term>, continued those efforts.</para>

    <title>An “Evil Empire”</title>
    <para id="para-00014">In a speech delivered in March 1983, President Ronald <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Reagan</term> called for peace with the Soviet Union but on U.S. terms. Specifically, Reagan said he would not agree to arms limitation talks until the United States was equal to the Soviet Union in military capacity. In his speech, he described the contest between the two countries as one between good and evil.</para>

    <para id="para-00020">When the new leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Gorbachev</term>, came to power in 1985, discontent was simmering in the Soviet Union and in the countries of Eastern Europe. Shortages of food and other goods were making people angry. In <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Poland</term> in 1980, shipyard workers under the leadership of labor activist Lech <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">Wałęsa</term> formed a trade union and went on strike to protest government policies. Within a year, one-third of Poland’s population had joined the Solidarity union. The Polish government tried to suppress the movement and banned the union, but its ten million members could not be silenced. Pope John Paul II, himself a Pole and an opponent of communism, called upon the Polish church to support the workers.</para>
    <para id="para-00021">Gorbachev realized the need for reform in the Soviet Union. The country simply could not afford to both compete militarily with the United States and provide its citizens what they needed to lead decent lives. Gorbachev thus willingly entered into arms limitation talks with Reagan. He also began a program of <term id="term-00027"><emphasis effect="italics">perestroika</emphasis></term>, a “restructuring” of the Soviet state and economy. He cut military spending and encouraged the beginnings of private enterprise. As part of his reform efforts, Gorbachev also encouraged <term id="term-00028"><emphasis effect="italics">glasnost</emphasis></term> or openness, allowing those who were angry to be critical of the government.</para>
    <para id="para-00022">Changes in the Soviet Union mirrored changes taking place elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc. In 1988, protests broke out again in Poland, and strikes swept the country. The Polish government was forced to negotiate with Solidarity leaders and make concessions to them, including free elections for some government offices. In 1989, Hungary and East Germany opened their borders, allowing their citizens to come and go freely. Berliners climbed atop the wall that divided their city and began to tear it down. People in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia called for changes in their government as well. Soviet tanks did not roll through the streets, and troops did not arrest or fire upon protesters. Gorbachev informed other members of the Soviet government that he did not intend to use military might to maintain control of Eastern Europe. In 1990, Germany was reunified, and the capital was returned to Berlin.</para>
    <para id="para-00023">But the reforms <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Gorbachev</term> initiated to save the Soviet Union eventually tore it apart. The Soviet republics also wanted their independence. Advocates of reform and democracy pushed for greater change. Not everyone in the Soviet Union was pleased by the reforms taking place, though. In August 1991, conservative members of the Communist Party attempted to remove Gorbachev from power, only to be foiled by the actions of Boris <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Yeltsin</term>, the president of the Russian republic. Acting together, Yeltsin and the presidents of the Soviet republics of Belarus and Ukraine voted in December 1991 to dissolve the Soviet Union. The Cold War was at an end.</para>
    <para id="para-00024">Ironically, the collapse of the Eastern Bloc also meant the demise of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Yugoslavia</term>, which had tried so hard to stand apart from it. The need to present a united front to the Soviet Union and the other Warsaw Pact nations had served as a powerful glue binding together the many disparate ethnic groups and states that comprised Yugoslavia. Had Tito lived, the country might have remained unified for a while longer, but he died in May 1980. In 1991 the states of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">Slovenia</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Croatia</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">Bosnia-Herzegovina</term> declared their independence from Yugoslavia. When Serbian minorities in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo attempted to proclaim their independence from these larger states, violence broke out. Slobodan <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">Milošević</term>, the former president of both the state of Serbia and of Yugoslavia, funded Serb rebels in Bosnia and conducted a genocidal campaign against the Albanians of Kosovo. He was indicted for war crimes by the United Nations in 2001 and died in prison in 2006.</para>

    <title>The Retreat of Communism: China</title>
    <para id="para-00026">The excesses of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">Cultural Revolution</term> in China spelled the end of both <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">Mao Zedong</term>’s power and, ironically, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">Chinese Revolution</term>. By the time of Lin Biao’s death in 1971, China had suffered badly. The economy was in shambles. The government had difficulty fulfilling basic functions. As Mao retreated into depression and ill health, his role was increasingly taken over by “The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">Gang of Four</term>,” consisting of Mao’s wife Jiang Qing, his chosen successor Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan. However, they were primarily concerned with ensuring ideological purity and the continuation of “revolutionary” political thought. Crucial matters such as the economy were left in the hands of Premier Zhou Enlai.</para>
    <para id="para-00027"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">Zhou</term>, however, was dying of cancer and needed help, so with Mao’s permission he returned <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">Deng Xiaoping</term> to power to assist him (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). Zhou and Deng managed the government and the economy, with more of the work falling to Deng as Zhou withdrew from public life. Following Zhou’s death in January 1976, the Gang of Four managed to oust Deng Xiaoping from power once more, but this time he did not remain away for long.</para>

    <para id="para-00028">Following Mao’s death on September 9, 1976, his successor Hua Guofeng had the Gang of Four arrested and Deng returned to power. Deng was made vice premier in 1977 and used his position to reverse the mistakes of the Cultural Revolution. In 1978, he replaced Hua as leader of China and argued that the country needed to focus on modernizing and building its economy instead of continuing to pursue revolution by following the teachings of Mao. He instituted a policy of <emphasis effect="italics">Boluan Fanzheng</emphasis> (“correct the wrong/return to normal”), in which the reputations of those imprisoned were “rehabilitated,” and those still alive were returned to power. The Chinese system of higher education returned to normal as Deng reinstated entrance examinations, which had been suspended during the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">Cultural Revolution</term>. He declared that scientists and intellectuals were deserving of respect because modernization could not proceed without their contributions.</para>
    <para id="para-00029">Deng also instituted a sweeping set of economic reforms based on the “Four Modernizations” of agriculture, industry, defense, and science and technology. Collective farms were broken up and entrepreneurs encouraged to start their own businesses. The country was opened to foreign investment, and foreign companies were invited to open Chinese branches. In the 1980s and 1990s, a few elements of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">capitalism</term> were introduced. Private management of many state industries was allowed, and although the largest remained under government control, people’s incomes and the Chinese standard of living swiftly improved. Along with economic changes, alterations took place in foreign policy. In the 1980s, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">China</term> decreased its support for revolutionary activity in other countries, with some exceptions, such as its support for anti-Soviet forces in Afghanistan and for Cambodians fighting the Vietnamese invasion. Beginning in the late 1980s, relations with the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">Soviet Union</term> also began to improve, and trade between the USSR and China increased.</para>
    <para id="para-00030">In 1980, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">Deng</term> called for political reform as well. He criticized the cumbersome Chinese bureaucracy and called for term limits on political positions and a redrafting of the constitution. However, he had no intention of allowing opposition to the rule of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">Chinese Communist Party (CCP)</term>. In 1986, university students began a series of protests in major Chinese cities. The government suppressed their actions, but in 1989 protests broke out again.</para>
    <para id="para-00031">Beginning on April 17, students in Beijing gathered at <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">Tiananmen Square</term> to mourn the recent death of party official Hu Yaobang, who had supported them. Influenced by Western media, they called for democratic reform, an end to government censorship, greater rights to protest, and more money for education. They and other protesters also decried corruption in the CCP and what they perceived as mismanagement of China’s economy. Reforms had improved life for farmers, but industrial workers and urban dwellers had not benefited. In the coming weeks, some students marched through the streets in angry protest, while others refused to abandon the square. On the evening of June 3, 1989, tanks entered Beijing, and over the next several days armed troops and tanks cleared the square, killing anywhere from several hundred to several thousand people (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>). On June 9, Deng denounced the students for attempting to overthrow the government. In other Chinese cities, the protests ended peacefully.</para>

    <title>Section Summary</title>
    <para id="para-00032">In the 1980s, communism began to loosen its grip on parts of the world in which it had once been dominant. The Soviet Union found itself divided by the need to provide for its citizens at home, maintain control over its satellite states in Eastern Europe, fight a war in Afghanistan, and respond to the buildup of nuclear and conventional weapons that took place during the administrations of U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Mikhail Gorbachev’s efforts to strengthen the Soviet Union through <emphasis effect="italics">perestroika</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">glasnost</emphasis> proved unsuccessful. When the Warsaw Pact nations sought independence in the late 1980s, the Soviet Union was unable to respond as it once had, and faced with liberation movements in its own republics, the USSR disbanded in 1991. Although China did not turn its back on communism, the death of Mao allowed Deng to institute reforms that introduced elements of capitalism to the Chinese economy.</para>
