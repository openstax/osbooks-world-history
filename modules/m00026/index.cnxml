    <para id="para-00201">War is often a catalyst for societal change, and this was certainly true of World War I. Women had long fought for increased political rights, and the next decade saw the franchise for women expand in several countries. Women also adopted freer styles of dress and defied traditional gender roles by working outside the home and dancing and drinking in public. Likewise, the status of African Americans in the United States drew more attention as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00308">civil rights</term> leaders emphasized the contributions of African American veterans to showcase the need for fair treatment, and writers and musicians used their work to give voice to the Black experience and to honor their heritage. Many countries embarked on efforts to incorporate more democratic principles. It was not an easy process, and many nations continued to face significant challenges in achieving their goals. The 1920s and 1930s also witnessed the growth of new forms of popular culture&#8212;the radio and movies&#8212;that appealed to the masses.</para>

    <title>The Expansion of Democracy</title>
    <para id="para-00202">When the war ended, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00309">suffrage movement</term> had been going on for several decades in the United States and Britain. Those who protested in support of women&#8217;s right to vote, called a <term id="term-00447">suffragist</term>, had sometimes taken radical action to highlight their cause, such as Emily <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00310">Davison</term> who threw herself in front of the King of England&#8217;s horse at a derby in 1913 and was killed. Suffragist leaders in both countries were often arrested, and many went on hunger strikes while in jail, enduring forced feedings to draw more attention to the cause.</para>
    <para id="para-00203">Women&#8217;s support of the war and their physical work in war industries and the medical corps led politicians to look more favorably on the idea of women voting. Women won the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00311">right to vote</term> in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00312">United States</term> in 1920, though it was couched as a reward for their war service. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00313">Britain</term> adopted a phase-in approach. First, women over thirty who met a property qualification were given the right to vote in 1918. Then in 1928, the vote was extended to women twenty-one and older. The property qualifications for men were abolished in 1918, and all men twenty-one and older were allowed to vote. For those in the military, the age limit was lowered to nineteen.</para>
    <para id="para-00204">Other countries joined the trend. German women won the right to vote in 1918. The new country of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00314">Poland</term> extended the vote to women immediately. Other countries still imposed limitations, such as property qualifications or the need to be a war widow in order to vote. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00315">France</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00316">Italy</term> lagged behind; women could not vote in either country until 1945. In <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00317">Japan</term>, female activist groups argued for a role in politics throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Japanese law changed to allow women to attend political rallies, but women did not receive the right to vote until after World War II. Rising <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00318">feminism</term> in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00319">China</term> linked to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00320">May Fourth Movement</term> helped women obtain individual property rights under the law.</para>
    <para id="para-00205">Individual female voices were also heard. Huda <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00321">Sha&#8217;arawi</term> founded the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00322">Egyptian Feminist Union</term> in 1923 and stopped wearing her veil and headscarf. She had already been engaged in providing education for girls and was active in the Egyptian independence movement. She became vice president of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00323">International Women&#8217;s Union</term> in the 1930s. Zaynab <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00324">al-Ghazali</term> founded the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00325">Muslim Women&#8217;s Society</term> in Europe in 1936. Al-Ghazali contended that women could play a role in politics outside the home while still being adherents to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00326">Islam</term>.</para>

    <para id="para-00207">Several minority groups in the United States hoped military service would gain them wider acceptance and rights. More than eleven thousand <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00327">Native Americans</term> served in the military during the war, and many hoped this volunteer service would provide them U.S. citizenship. Native Americans were in fact granted citizenship in 1924. Another group hoping for change were <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00328">African Americans</term>. Long subject to discriminatory laws and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00329">racial segregation</term>, African Americans felt World War I offered them an opportunity to prove themselves loyal citizens. The United States operated a segregated military, and all-Black service member units serving overseas had a unique chance to see how other places treated them. Those in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00330">France</term>, in particular, were struck by the freedom of movement and acceptance they found there. They were allowed in combat, while U.S. units kept them largely in support roles. There was genuine optimism that life in the United States would be different after the war.</para>
    <para id="para-00208">However, after 1918, many found that little had changed. Discriminatory laws remained in place, and poor treatment even of veterans was commonplace. What was new was the prospect of mobility. In 1917, the lure of good-paying industrial jobs producing items for the war began drawing African American workers and families north. This movement continued after the war as factories began to pump out consumer products. By 1920, more than a million African Americans had left the south in a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00331">Great Migration</term>, which continued through the next decades as well.</para>

    <title>Marcus Garvey on Race in the United States</title>
    <para id="para-00209">Marcus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00332">Garvey</term> was a Jamaican-born activist who spoke and wrote about <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00333">Pan-Africanism</term> and the need to address racial issues worldwide. This is an excerpt from his 1923 speech, &#8220;A Last Word Before Incarceration.&#8221; As you read, notice his characterization of African Americans.</para>
    <quote id="quote-00701"><para id="para-00210">Those of you who have been observing events for the last four or five weeks with keen eyes and keen perceptions will come to no other conclusion than this&#8212;that through the effort to strangle the Universal Negro Improvement Association&#8212;through the effort to silence Marcus Garvey&#8212;there is a mad desire, there is a great plan to permanently lay the Negro low in this civilization and in future civilizations. But the world is sadly mistaken. No longer can the Negro be laid low; in laying the Negro low you but bring down the pillars of creation, because 400,000,000 Negroes are determined to [be] a man, to take a place in the world and to hold that place. The world is sadly mistaken and rudely shocked at the same time. They thought that the new Negro would bend; they thought that the new Negro was only bluffing and would exhibit the characteristic of the old Negro when pushed to the corner or pushed to the wall. If you want to see the new Negro fight, force him to the wall, and the nearer he approaches the wall the more he fights, and when he gets to the wall he is even more desperate.</para>

    <para id="para-00212">Racism was not absent in the North. The summer of 1919 was marked by race riots in many cities, and in the 1920s the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00335">Ku Klux Klan</term>, a White supremacist group formed after the Civil War, spread throughout the nation. Nevertheless, northern <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00336">racism</term> seemed mild compared to what African Americans&#8217; southern experience had been, and greater opportunities for jobs and education continued to draw people to the cities of the North and Midwest. New livelihoods and membership in civil rights groups such as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00337">NAACP</term> drew many into the <term id="term-00448">New Negro movement</term> in the 1920s. This drive &#8220;promoted a renewed sense of racial pride, cultural self-expression, economic independence, and progressive politics.&#8221; One of the movement&#8217;s first tasks was to agitate for a federal anti-lynching law. Lynching had become a vigilante crime whose targets were overwhelmingly African American. Anti-lynching activists knew that White men who murdered African Americans would not be punished by southern state courts. By making <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00338">lynching</term> a crime that would be tried in a federal court, however, they hoped to achieve greater justice. An anti-lynching bill came up for a vote in Congress in 1922 but was rejected, and again in 1935. White southern politicians resisted any federal intrusion, even in humanitarian causes.</para>
    <para id="para-00213">Racial pride also influenced the artists of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00339">Harlem Renaissance</term>, an outpouring of African American literature, art, and music named for a neighborhood in New York City in which many African American participants in the Great Migration settled. The Harlem Renaissance, which was in full bloom in the 1920s, brought into the mainstream the work of many African American writers, such as poet Langston <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00340">Hughes</term> and Zora Neale <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00341">Hurston</term>, who wrote about the racial struggles of twentieth-century African Americans in her novels, short stories, and plays. The music of African American communities in Harlem and elsewhere featured the distinctive <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00342">blues</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00343">jazz</term> styles, which both became international genres and provided the soundtrack for the dynamic changes of the decade following World War I.</para>

    <para id="para-00215">The Harlem Renaissance, especially the works of Jamaican-born Claude <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00344">McKay</term>, in turn inspired the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00345">N&#233;gritude movement</term>, a literary movement that emerged in French-speaking parts of Africa and the Americas. The movement was founded by L&#233;opold S&#233;dar <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00346">Senghor</term>, a Senegalese poet and university professor. N&#233;gritude, a term coined by Aim&#233; <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00347">C&#233;saire</term>, a poet and playwright from the Caribbean island of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00348">Martinique</term> (at that time a French colony), called upon Blacks to reject European culture and values in favor of African ones.</para>

    <title>Democratic Yearnings</title>
    <para id="para-00216">The dismantling of empires at the end of the war was clearly a boon for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00349">democracy</term>, but it was not always easy for fledgling countries to adopt new political systems. The tense situation in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00350">Ireland</term> of the 1920s was just one example.</para>
    <para id="para-00217">In 1922, the <term id="term-00449">Irish Free State</term> was created through the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00351">Anglo-Irish Treaty</term>. This 1921 pact ended the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00352">Irish War of Independence</term> that had begun in 1918 when the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00353">Irish Republican Army (IRA)</term> and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00354">Irish Nationalist Party</term> fought British rule. Groups such as <term id="term-00450">Sinn F&#233;in</term> (&#8220;We Ourselves&#8221;), organized in 1905 to fight for an independent Ireland, were often associated with the IRA and sometimes adopted more violent measures than the more moderate Irish Nationalist Party. They had the same goal but very different methods.</para>
    <para id="para-00218">The Anglo-Irish Treaty initiated a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00355">vote</term> on the future of Ireland. The six northern counties, largely Protestant, voted to remain part of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00356">United Kingdom</term>, but the other twenty-six formed the Irish Free State and received dominion status in the British Empire. As a dominion, the Irish Free State could make and enforce its own laws, make treaties, appoint ambassadors, and send its own representatives to international organizations. A sizable number of Catholics remained in the northern counties, however, which ultimately led to long-term violence. And while the new arrangement was a significant improvement over the past, it did not fully satisfy many Irish republicans, who wanted complete independence for Ireland. Sinn F&#233;in itself was split; some members wanted greater sovereignty for Ireland and for the entire island to be rid of the British presence. A brief civil war broke out between the IRA and the Free State, but the Free State emerged victorious. In 1937, it was reorganized under a new government headed by &#201;amon de <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00357">Valera</term>, an anti-treaty leader, and took the name &#8220;Ireland.&#8221;</para>
    <para id="para-00219"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00358">Japan</term> also took steps toward becoming more democratic for a brief period after World War I. In 1912, a new emperor, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00359">Taisho</term>, had ushered in a period of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00360">liberalism</term> with democratic and progressive politics. For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00361">labor strikes</term>, such as the rice riots in 1918 in which tens of thousands of people protested the government&#8217;s failure to pay market prices for rice, became increasingly common as workers fought for better wages and working conditions. Women became active in labor unions and politics for the first time, and the number of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00362">unions</term> more than tripled in the 1910s. During this period, Japan was viewed as a triumph of constitutional government.</para>
    <para id="para-00220">However, the progressive period did not last long. In 1923, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00363">Great Kanto Earthquake</term>, measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale, destroyed two major cities, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00364">Yokohama</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00365">Tokyo</term>. Nearly 150,000 people died in the earthquake and the resulting fires and tsunamis (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). Rumors quickly spread that Koreans in the area were taking advantage of the chaos, were plotting political insurrection, and had already poisoned wells to contaminate the drinking water. Several thousand <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00366">Koreans</term> were targeted and killed in response. The devastation also provided an opportunity for the conservative and pro-military forces in the Japanese government to exercise increased control over society. Martial law was declared, and the repression of radicals was stepped up. Political activists who questioned government policies disappeared.</para>

    <para id="para-00221">When the emperor died in 1926, his son <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00367">Hirohito</term> ascended to power, and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00368">Sh&#246;wa</term> period began. Japan&#8217;s political system now became increasingly dominated by the military, and the emperor&#8217;s role was shrouded in secrecy and worship. The country&#8217;s military leaders believed more aggressive actions were needed for Japan to control the Pacific as they wanted to.</para>
    <para id="para-00222">Operating with a heightened sense of duty and honor, Japan&#8217;s military establishment and certain factions of its army became increasingly contemptuous of civilian leaders. By the late 1920s, they saw these politicians as incapable of solving domestic issues or addressing challenges from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00369">China</term> and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00370">Soviet Union</term>. Some disaffected Japanese field commanders in China and the Japanese colony of Korea began to engage in direct actions, forming criminal conspiracies and cover-ups to secure the future of Japan as they saw it, even as they served the emperor.</para>
    <para id="para-00223">Nationalistic secret societies such as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00371">Cherry Blossom Association</term> and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00372">Blood-Pledge Corps</term> blossomed within the Japanese armed forces, particularly in the prestigious <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00373">Kwantung Army</term> stationed in Korea. The Japanese chafed at perceived unequal treatment in world affairs, such as at the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00374">Washington Naval Conference</term>. Anxiety rose about the growth of Chinese nationalism under Chiang <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00375">Kai-shek</term> and the nationalist <term id="term-00451">Guomindang</term> government, and what it might mean for Japanese interests in China.</para>
    <para id="para-00224"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00376">Manchuria</term>, which bordered Korea, was a semiautonomous province of China. In 1931, to precipitate a political crisis that would enable Japan to intervene, hyper-patriots in the Japanese army conspired to blow up a portion of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00377">South Manchurian Railway</term> near the Manchurian city of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00378">Mukden</term> (Shenyang) and blamed the incident on Chinese nationalists. The local Japanese commander took the opportunity to occupy Mukden, and field commanders in Korea dispatched reinforcements without any orders from Tokyo to do so. Japanese public opinion supported the army&#8217;s action.</para>
    <para id="para-00225">As the Japanese army fanned out in Manchuria, the Kwantung Army approached the former Chinese Emperor, Pu Yi, who had been living in the Japanese concession (an area of the city granted to Japan) in Tianjin since 1925 (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). The Japanese convinced Pu <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00379">Yi</term> they had acted in the interests of the Manchurian people to preserve law and order in his homeland. They then smuggled him back to Manchuria, and by March 1932, he had been persuaded to accept the position of &#8220;chief executive&#8221; of the newly born state of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00380">Manchukuo</term>, otherwise known as Manchuria. As the Chinese government called for the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00381">League of Nations</term> to intervene and pledged to accept its rulings, a British diplomat in Japan warned of &#8220;an atmosphere of gun-grease&#8221; in Japan.</para>

    <para id="para-00228">The Japanese secret societies within the military were animated by an exaggerated sense of Japan&#8217;s destiny. They began a campaign of violence against the Japanese civilian government. Elements of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00387">Imperial Navy</term> launched a coup in March 1932 by executing Japan&#8217;s former finance minister, Junnosuke <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00388">Inoue</term>, and Baron <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00389">Dan</term>, the head of Mitsui Corporation, as traitors to the Japanese people. On May 15, Prime Minister Inukai <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00390">Tsuyoshi</term> was shot to death by eleven young naval officers.

    <para id="para-00229">In the first half of the twentieth century, the dominant political party in Japan was a fusion of Meiji oligarchs, government bureaucrats, and recruits from other political parties. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00391"><emphasis effect="italics">Seiyukai</emphasis></term>, as it was named, consistently supported a march toward authoritarian government. Beginning in 1932, &#8220;national unity&#8221; governments dominated by high-ranking military officers increasingly assumed power and repressed threats and enemies. Authoritarian government took hold from the top down in the mid-1930s, as the military intimidated and overpowered civilian governance and created a military dictatorship.</para>
    <para id="para-00230">The situation in China was quite fluid through the 1920s and 1930s. Revolutionary activity grew but splintered, and the opposing views of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00392">Communists</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00393">Nationalists</term> led to civil war. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00394">Guomindang</term> was led by Sun <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00395">Yat-sen</term> from 1912 until his death in 1925. Sun Yat-sen developed a more inclusive party and made an alliance with those who followed the communist path. After his death, Chiang <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00396">Kai-shek</term> arose as the leader of the Nationalists. Chiang focused on more traditional positions, and in the late 1920s, he chose to formally oust the communist members of the Guomindang.</para>
    <para id="para-00231">One of the people who had joined the communist ranks was a young member from Hunan Province, Mao <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00397">Zedong</term> (<link target-id="fig-00004"/>). Mao had had intermittent schooling but was drawn to the revolutionary fervor of the Russian Revolution of 1917. He had supported both the communist cause and the Guomindang, but after Chiang ousted the communists, Mao took up arms against him.</para>

    <para id="para-00232">Mao viewed <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00398">communism</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00399">Marxism</term> in a rather unorthodox way. Generally, Marxism relied on the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00400">proletariat</term>, the industrial workers in the factories, gaining class consciousness. However, this model did not exist in China, a land of mostly <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00401">agricultural peasants</term> and little industrialization. So Mao came to believe that a Marxist state could be built on the peasantry rather than on industrial workers. Chinese communists would seek to overthrow not the capitalists but the landlords who controlled the land. This was a powerful tonic for the mass of Chinese peasants, who hungered for land reform. Such reform would oust the landlords and return all the land to the hands of the peasants who worked on it.</para>
    <para id="para-00233">The Nationalists themselves had encouraged assistance from the Soviet Union in the early 1920s, and the Soviet Union had responded with aid and training. Once <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00402">Chiang</term> became head of the Nationalists, however, he decided to break with the Communists and planned an extermination of the Communist forces. This forced many into hiding, but in 1935, Mao was able to lead them on the <term id="term-00452">Long March</term> to a safe retreat in northern China. Many flocked to Mao and his oratory about a new government in China that reflected the will of the people. In 1937, however, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00403">Japan</term>ese Empire invaded mainland <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00404">China</term>. Chiang offered Mao a truce, setting aside the civil war in favor of fighting against the invading forces. Still, the internal battles between these two sides weakened the war effort against the Japanese.</para>
    <para id="para-00234">In Southeast Asia, themes of nationalism were also growing in popularity. Following his inability to be heard at negotiations for the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00405">Treaty of Versailles</term>, Ho Chi <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00406">Minh</term> had returned home to the northern part of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00407">French Indochina</term> (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) and organized <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00408">guerrilla</term> fighters to begin ousting the French. Championing Vietnamese nationalism, Ho had received training from the Soviet Union and hoped communism would provide a path for his country to achieve independence.</para>
    <para id="para-00235"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00409">Turkey</term> welcomed the spread of democratic institutions in the 1920s. After the triumph of his nationalist party in the early 1920s, Mustafa Kemal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00410">Atat&#252;rk</term> established a republic with a constitution and regular elections. The Republic of Turkey disassociated itself from the old Ottoman rule by adopting many Westernized elements. Women had the right to vote, the Arabic alphabet was no longer used, and traditional dress (veils for women and the fez for men) was outlawed. European fashion became the norm. Another major shift in Turkey was its adoption of a fully secular society. The legal system was overhauled to focus on a civil code like those of other European countries rather than on Islamic law.</para>
    <para id="para-00236">Latin American countries, too, had some success expanding democracy in the 1920s. In 1910, revolution broke out in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00411">Mexico</term>. A struggle over leadership followed in which Mexico was governed by a succession of revolutionary generals without any established way for the next president to come to power. The creation of a political party was meant to fix this, and by the 1920s, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00412">PRI (the Institutional Revolutionary Party)</term> had been formed. Though subject to name changes through the decades, this party dominated Mexican politics until the twenty-first century. There were regular elections and an expansion of voting, reflecting at least the outward acceptance of democratic institutions. However, the PRI effectively ran a one-party state, and all presidents and nearly all the members of the legislature were members of the party. In 1938, a new president, L&#225;zaro <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00413">C&#225;rdenas</term>, focused on the plight of ordinary workers in Mexico. He supported labor unions, nationalized the oil industry, promoted land reform, and attempted to bring more socialist policies to Mexico.</para>
    <para id="para-00237">Other countries throughout Latin America extended voting rights in the early 1900s. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00414">Chile</term> suffered its share of chaos as reformers tried to seize political power there. Ultimately, Chile was able to build a series of coalition governments in the 1930s that brought stability for many years. By the 1920s, political instability was increasingly common in other places like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00415">Argentina</term>. In September 1930, General Jos&#233; F&#233;lix <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00416">Uriburu</term> seized power in the capital, Buenos Aires. Uriburu had been heavily influenced by the Italian version of fascism. He banned political parties and suspended the constitution. His was the first of several military coups that occurred in Argentina in the ensuing decades.</para>

    <title>A New Culture for the Masses</title>
    <para id="para-00238">Alongside the expansion of democracy, the 1920s also shepherded in a new world of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00417">mass culture</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00418">mass media</term>. Technological innovations let people connect nearly instantaneously and have shared experiences without being in the same place. Where the infrastructure existed, it was radio and the movies that made this possible.</para>
    <para id="para-00239">Radio wave technology had been pioneered in the late 1800s, but its widespread use and cultural influence were still decades off. By the 1920s, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00419">radio</term>&#8217;s value as a news medium was becoming clear, but its true influence came from commercial radio shows, supported through another new medium called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00420">advertising</term> that filled the airwaves in the mid-1920s. From that point through the interwar years, people could gather to hear the latest episodes of entertaining soap operas, mystery shows, and westerns, along with news items and live reporting of sports events.</para>
    <para id="para-00240">Silent films had ruled movie theaters in the 1900s and 1910s, but beginning in the late 1920s, &#8220;<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00421">talking pictures</term>&#8221; emerged and quickly became the dominant form of motion pictures. Mass media technologies meant people could watch the same movies, follow the same soap operas, and cheer for the same teams despite being hundreds or thousands of miles apart. These experiences created a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00422">mass culture</term> for the first time, uniting people whose lives had once been dominated by regional and local concerns.</para>
    <para id="para-00241">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00423">film</term> industries in many countries developed somewhat differently in the 1930s. In the United States, the industry was centered in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00424">Hollywood</term>, a district in Los Angeles, California. The bosses of movie studios wanted to make films that were popular with audiences and relatively cheap to produce. In other countries, the film industries were similarly popular, but many were also supportive of artistic experimentation in film. The German film industry took a modernist approach, seen in the silent 1920 horror film <emphasis effect="italics">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</emphasis>, for example, and many of its films critiqued politics and society in the postwar era. In Japan, the film industry went through a period of reform in the 1920s as producers and directors began adopting different filmmaking techniques instead of simply recording a theatrical production. Some films took leftist positions that reflected the growth of unions in Japanese society, but other genres such as those featuring <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00425"><emphasis effect="italics">samurai</emphasis></term> characters also became popular and well known.</para>
    <para id="para-00242">People were also embracing new ways of living in the 1920s. Women, in particular, were ready to fulfill their updated expectations for themselves. The &#8220;<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00426">New Woman</term>&#8221; of this era abandoned the traditions of the past to enter an exciting future. Women in many countries were also adopting new plans for their lives, such as pursuing higher education, although a college degree was still quite rare among women. There were also many new jobs in the workplace that women were eager to hold. In Europe and the United States, secretarial work was becoming dominated by women rather than the men who had held such jobs in the 1800s. Nursing also became an important career option for women.</para>
    <para id="para-00243">The New Woman was a significant departure from the nineteenth-century Western woman, who wore her long hair piled high on her head and dressed in high-necked blouses and ankle-length skirts. Young women in the 1920s wore knee-length skirts, discarded corsets, and cut their hair short. They went out in the evenings to drink and dance and socialize. A woman who adopted these behaviors became known as a <term id="term-00453">flapper</term> in the United States, due to the way these women danced with arms flapping from their sides (<link target-id="fig-00005"/>).</para>

    <para id="para-00244">The spread of this modern image of a woman demonstrated the influence the West and especially the United States already had on popular culture. The New Woman appeared around the world on signs, in books, in song lyrics, and throughout the burgeoning movie industry. Advertisers, in particular, were quick to adopt her image, making it one to which female consumers could aspire. Each country had its own version&#8212;the <emphasis effect="italics">moga</emphasis> (modern girl) in Japan, the <emphasis effect="italics">gar&#231;onne</emphasis> (tomboy or flapper) in France.</para>

    <para id="para-00246">The years following World War I left many democratic yearnings unfulfilled around the globe. African Americans in the United States were able to seize new job opportunities and greater mobility, but they still faced marked racism and limitations. Efforts toward self-rule in Ireland made substantial progress but were also tainted by violence. The promise of greater democracy in China was subsumed by civil war. In Latin America, the hope of greater equality among social classes was frustrated by political instability and the first appearance of more authoritarian leaders. Many aspects of Western society wound their way around the globe via the new technologies of mass media. Peoples around the world clearly wanted change, but implementing it sometimes proved exceedingly difficult.</para>
