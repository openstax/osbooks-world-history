By the third millennium BCE, the inhabitants of these lands were already producing wine and olive oil, products in high demand in ancient Egypt and the Near East. The Aegean Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Late Bronze Age</term> (c. 1600–1100 BCE) thus shared in the economic prosperity and cultural interaction that linked the eastern Mediterranean with the ancient cultures of western Asia.</para>

They established trading posts across the Mediterranean as far as Spain, often in search of new sources of iron ore and other metals such as tin. The arrival of the Phoenicians and Greek traders in the western Mediterranean brought them into contact with the Etruscans in the Italian peninsula. Thus, the period from the Bronze Age through the Iron Age witnessed the development of numerous cultures across the Mediterranean.</para>

They all possessed military forces of elite warriors trained to fight from horse-drawn chariots. They interacted using a common set of diplomatic practices: Official correspondence was often written in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Akkadian cuneiform</term>, military alliances were sealed by arranged marriages between the royal families of allied states, and vassal states paid tribute to dominant states to avoid military assault.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">These civilizations also exchanged prized goods, such as wine and oil from Greece, cedar logs from the <term id="term-00008">Levant</term> (modern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria), and copper from the island of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Cyprus</term>.

    <title>Minoan Crete and Mycenaean Greece</title>
    <para id="para-00007">By 2000 BCE, a unique culture had developed on the Aegean island of Crete, reaching the height of its power at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age around 1600 BCE. The later Classical Greeks told the myth of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">King Minos</term> of Crete, who built a giant maze known as the Labyrinth and imprisoned there a half-man, half-bull called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Minotaur</term> (the “Bull of Minos”). To avenge his own son’s death, Minos forced young men and women from Athens in Greece to enter the Labyrinth and be eaten by the monster. Historians see in the myth a distant memory of the earlier civilization on Crete and use the term Minoan, derived from Minos, to describe it.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Minoans</term> built spacious palaces on Crete, the largest at <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Knossos</term>. Since these were usually unfortified, historians believe Crete was generally peaceful and united under a single government with Knossos as the capital. The Minoans also established settlements and trading posts on other Aegean islands such as Thera and along the Anatolian coast. Their palaces were huge complexes that served as economic and administrative centers. To keep records for these centers the Minoans developed their own script, written on clay tablets and known to scholars as <term id="term-00017">Linear A</term>. It has not yet been deciphered.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">A common weapon and symbol in these palaces was the <emphasis effect="italics">labrys</emphasis>, or double ax, from which the word “labyrinth” arose. In the courtyards, young men and women participated in bullfights that may be the basis for the myth of the Minotaur. Frescoes on the palace walls depict these fights as well as sea creatures and scenes from nature (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). The Minoan religion revered bulls and a goddess associated with snakes, nature, and fertility. The abundance of figurines of this snake-wielding female deity and other artistic depictions of women may mean that at least some women enjoyed high social status in Minoan society. Religious rituals were practiced in small shrines as well as on mountain tops and in caves and sacred forests.</para>

    <para id="para-00011">Sometime around 1500 BCE, the palaces on Crete were destroyed. Knossos was rebuilt, and scribes there began employing a new script scholars call <term id="term-00018">Linear B</term>, apparently derived from Linear A and found to be an early form of Greek. Linear B clay tablets discovered on the Greek mainland led historians to conclude that Greeks from the mainland conquered Crete and rebuilt Knossos.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Bronze Age</term> culture that produced Linear B is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Mycenaean</term> since the largest Bronze Age city in Greece was at <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Mycenae</term>. Bronze Age Greeks appear to have migrated from the Balkans into mainland Greece around 2000 BCE and adopted Minoan civilization around the beginning of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Late Bronze Age</term>, in 1600 BCE. Unlike the Minoans, the Mycenaean Greeks were divided into a number of separate kingdoms. Immense palace complexes like those at Knossos have been found at Mycenae, Tiryns, Thebes, Pylos, and Sparta, sometimes surrounded by monumental fortifications. These locations correspond to the powerful kingdoms described in the later Greek epic poem the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023"><emphasis effect="italics">Iliad</emphasis></term>, attributed to the poet <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Homer</term>. This poem tells the story of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Trojan War</term>, in which the Greek kingdoms, led by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">King Agamemnon</term> of Mycenae, waged war against the city of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Troy</term>. Archaeologists have also uncovered the Bronze Age city of Troy in western Turkey, which suggests the <emphasis effect="italics">Iliad</emphasis> was loosely based on oral traditions that preserved the memory of these ancient Bronze Age kingdoms. The Linear B tablets indicate that the ruler of these palaces was known as the <emphasis effect="italics">Wanax</emphasis> or “lord,” the same word used to describe the heroic kings of the <emphasis effect="italics">Iliad</emphasis>.</para>

    <title>The Collapse of the Bronze Age World</title>
    <para id="para-00013">The last century of the Late Bronze Age, after 1200 BCE, was a period of wars and invasions that witnessed the collapse of many powerful states. The palaces of Mycenaean Greece were destroyed, perhaps following revolts by the lower class and natural disasters like climate change and earthquakes. In the centuries that followed, the population declined drastically, writing and literacy disappeared, and Greece entered a “Dark Age.”</para>
    <para id="para-00014">Later ancient Greek historians reported that Greek-speaking tribes known as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Dorians</term> migrated from northwest Greece to the south after the Trojan War. The instability in Greece and the Aegean resulted in much migration by people in search of new homes. For instance, ancient Egyptian inscriptions tell us that the “<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Sea Peoples</term>” destroyed the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Hittite Empire</term> and numerous kingdoms in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Levant</term> to the north of Egypt. One particular group known as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">Philistines</term> (Peleset), who attacked <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Egypt</term>, eventually settled just north of Egypt along the coast of the southern Levant.

    <caption>The “Sea Peoples,” as they were called in Egyptian records, came largely from the Aegean region. By studying the remains of pottery and other archaeological traces, scholars have concluded that these groups moved through Greece and Crete and into North Africa, Cyprus, and the Levant (as shown by the blue arrows) at the close of the Late Bronze Age.

    <para id="para-00016">These wars and invasions coincided with an important technological innovation, the birth of sophisticated iron-making technology. For thousands of years, bronze had been the metal of choice in the ancient world. But the disruptions caused by the Late Bronze Age Collapse made it difficult for metal workers to access tin, a crucial ingredient in bronze. Without a sufficient supply of tin, artisans experimented for centuries with iron ore. In the process, they developed the techniques of steeling (adding carbon to the iron to make it stronger), quenching (rapidly cooling hot iron with water), and tempering (heat treating) to produce a metal far superior in strength to bronze. By around 900 BCE, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">Iron Age</term> had begun in the eastern Mediterranean.</para>

    <para id="para-00018">Around 1100 BCE, the Phoenicians also invented the world’s first known <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">alphabet</term>, using symbols that represented consonant sounds. Strung together, these consonants created words in which vowel sounds were interpreted by the order of the consonants. Because the Phoenician alphabet simplified the earlier script of the Canaanites, more people could now become literate, not just a small, specialized group of scribes. The Phoenicians’ commercial success was undoubtedly partly a result of their better, more efficient record-keeping system that a larger population could learn and employ. Other cultures like the Aramaean peoples and the Israelites quickly adapted the new script to their own languages. By the eighth century BCE, the Greeks had also adopted and later adapted the Phoenician alphabet to write their language.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">Beginning with the Assyrian Empire’s expansion in the eighth century BCE, the Phoenician kingdoms became subjects of the successive Iron Age empires of western Asia: the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">Assyrians</term>, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">Chaldeans</term> (Neo-Babylonian), and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">Persians</term>. The Phoenicians continued to flourish, however. The Assyrians valued Phoenician artists, and finely crafted Phoenician wares such as jewelry and furniture became popular among the ruling elites. The Persians relied largely on Phoenician sailors and ships to serve as the naval forces, especially in their campaigns to conquer Greece in the early fifth century BCE. When Phoenician city-states such as Sidon and Tyre became subject to foreign rule, many Phoenicians immigrated to the city of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">Carthage</term> (in modern-day Tunisia), founded by Phoenician merchants around 700 BCE as a stopping place on the long but profitable voyage to Spain. Given this influx of immigrants, Carthage grew large and wealthy, and by the fifth century BCE the southern Italian peninsula was the dominant power in the western Mediterranean.</para>
    <para id="para-00020">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">Phoenicians</term> were not the only people establishing colonial outposts around the wider Mediterranean world. Beginning in the eighth century, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">Greeks</term> began founding colonies in North Africa, in coastal Spain and France, on the shores of the Black Sea, and on the Italian peninsula. Many of these colonies were built in resource-rich areas and commonly produced grain, tin, or timber for export back to Greece.

    <para id="para-00022">Since ancient Rome began as an Etruscan city-state, the Etruscans strongly influenced the development of Roman culture. For example, Roman priests divined the will of the gods by examining a sacrificed animal’s entrails, a custom adopted from the Etruscans. The Etruscans honored their dead with elaborate tombs, and the Romans did the same, maintaining that the spirits of their ancestors watched over them. Gladiatorial contests in Rome had origins among the Etruscans, who at funerals forced prisoners of war to fight to the death as human sacrifices to their dead. The <emphasis effect="italics">fasces</emphasis>, a bundle of rods and an ax that symbolized the authority of Roman magistrates, originally denoted the authority of Etruscan kings. Finally, the Roman alphabet, still used in western and central Europe today, was based on Etruscan modifications to the Greek alphabet.</para>

The Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations emerged on the Aegean island of Crete and on mainland Greece. Minoan culture strongly influenced the art and culture of the Mycenaean civilization that followed it. Around 1200 BCE, these Late Bronze Age states collapsed in a wave of wars and migrations.</para>

During this transition, the Phoenicians built their civilization and invented the alphabet around 1100 BCE, establishing trade networks that linked the entire Mediterranean basin. The arrival of Phoenicians and especially Greeks in central Italy after 700 BCE contributed to the evolution of a new culture in Italy, the Etruscans. Their civilization made a deep impact on the later development of ancient Rome.</para>
