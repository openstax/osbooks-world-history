    <para id="para-00002">Millions of years ago, our distant ancestors descended from the trees, took to walking upright on the land, and gradually evolved into the species we are today. Their evolution was influenced by many variables, including changes in climate, diet, and survival strategies. Over time, humans developed new skills and tools to meet the challenges of endurance and sought better prospects for themselves through cooperation and migration.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">Understanding these changes and the long-ago origins of our species has required careful research by archaeologists, anthropologists, genetic scientists, historians, sociologists, and many others. Through painstaking reconstructions and study, these specialists have used a relatively small number of archaeological finds and material remnants of our distant ancestors to paint a striking picture of our prehistoric past, going back millions of years. The nature of this work, however, requires using some extrapolation, educated speculation, and outright guesswork to piece together the bits of unearthed evidence into an intelligible story. This means that even as we have had to discard old theories when new information has emerged, there remain plenty of things we’ll simply never know for sure.</para>

    <title>Human Evolution</title>
    <para id="para-00004">The concept of evolution over time is one we are all likely familiar with. Consider, for example, how technology has evolved. The first true smartphones appeared on the market at the beginning of this century, but these complicated devices didn’t spring all at once from the minds of ambitious engineers. Rather, these engineers built on technology that had evolved and improved over many decades. In the mid-1800s, telegraph technology first demonstrated that electricity could be used for long-distance communication. That technology paved the way for the first telephones, which were basic and expensive but over many decades became more sophisticated, more common, and cheaper. By the early 1980s, electronics companies had begun selling telephones that used radio technology to communicate wirelessly. Over time these devices were made faster and smaller, and companies added features like cameras, microprocessors, and eventually internet access. With these evolutionary transformations, the smartphone was born.</para>

    <para id="para-00006">Modern humans are not smartphones, and in human history, chance biological adaptations to a changing environment drove the evolutionary process rather than the minds of inventors conceiving of technical innovations. But the evolutionary process that eventually gave birth to our species resembles the technological evolution of smartphones and other devices in some important ways. Just like we can trace the evolution of the smartphone back to the telegraph, so can we trace our own evolution back to a very distant ancestor called <term id="term-00003"><emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus</emphasis></term>, who lived in eastern and southern Africa between 2.5 and 4 million years ago. Lucy, previously mentioned, was of the genus <emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus</emphasis> (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). A <term id="term-00004">genus</term> is a taxonomic rank that includes several similar and related species within it. Like us, members of Lucy’s species <emphasis effect="italics">afarensis</emphasis> (named for the Afar region of East Africa where she was found) were capable of walking upright and likely used tools. Beyond that, however, they were very different from us. They had plenty of hair like chimpanzees, fingers and arms well suited for climbing trees, and brains about one-third the size of ours. Despite these differences, scholars have concluded that the genus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005"><emphasis effect="italics">Homo</emphasis></term> (“human”) evolved from <emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus</emphasis> somewhere around two to three million years ago.</para>

    <para id="para-00008">Around two million years ago, a species even more similar to us, <term id="term-00007"><emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis>,</term> emerged in East Africa. It likely evolved from <emphasis effect="italics">Homo habilis</emphasis>. As the name <emphasis effect="italics">erectus</emphasis> for “upright” suggests, this species lived entirely on the ground and walked—even ran—exclusively in an upright position. The consequences of this evolutionary shift were huge. Being upright meant that the body’s digestive organs were pulled down lower and into a smaller space. That in turn necessitated a change in diet, away from tough plants and toward easier-to-digest items like nuts, fruits, tubers, honey, and even meat. Living on the ground was also more dangerous because it made eluding predators more difficult. However, the upright position left <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis>’s hands free to use tools. This advantage likely led to further evolutions that made human hands more dexterous over time, prompting the wider adoption of ever more sophisticated tools.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">Members of <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis> shared other close similarities with modern humans. They were about the same height as we are, sometimes reaching just over six feet. They made and used relatively sophisticated stone tools and relied on fire for both warmth and cooking food. They likely constructed huts of wood and fur in which to live and worked cooperatively with each other to hunt and forage. The position of the larynx in the throat also suggests that <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis> may have had some capacity to communicate vocally, which would have aided in cooperative endeavors. Finally, archaeologists have uncovered strong evidence that <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis> cared for the sick and elderly. This evidence includes the discovery of the remains of individuals who suffered from debilitating diseases yet lived a long time, indicating that assistance was both necessary and provided by others. Together these characteristics made the species highly adaptable to changing climates and environments, helping explain why its members survived for so long. <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis> populations lived until as recently as about 100,000 years ago.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">Sometime between 1.8 and 1.5 million years ago, <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis> started migrating into other parts of Africa and beyond, reaching North Africa, the Near East, Europe, and East and South Asia over hundreds of thousands of years. The reasons for this extensive migration are still debated, but they likely included climate change and the desire to follow certain types of prey. <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis> appears to have stayed close to rivers and lakes during migration, hunting and eating animals like rhinoceroses, bears, pigs, and crocodiles, as discoveries in the Near East have confirmed. Populations evolved to adapt to the different environmental conditions into which they moved. Over time this led to a diversity of human species, including <emphasis effect="italics">Homo heidelbergensis</emphasis>; <emphasis effect="italics">Homo neanderthalensis,</emphasis> or <term id="term-00008">Neanderthals</term>; Denisovans; and modern humans, or <term id="term-00009"><emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis></term> (<emphasis effect="italics">sapiens</emphasis> means “wise”). Some of these species, like Denisovans and Neanderthals, emerged outside Africa. Others<emphasis effect="italics">,</emphasis> like <emphasis effect="italics">Homo heidelbergensis</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis>, emerged in Africa first and later migrated to other areas.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">The extent to which these different human species interacted with each other remains unclear. DNA evidence from a bone found in Siberia has shown that a girl (who died at age thirteen) was born there of a Denisovan father and a Neanderthal mother. Another recent study demonstrated that modern European and Middle Eastern populations have between 1 and 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. This appears to suggest that mating between <emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis> and Neanderthals was quite common. The careful work of archaeologists and other scholars has also made clear that some species evolved from others. For example, both Neanderthals and Denisovans appear to have evolved from populations of <emphasis effect="italics">Homo heidelbergensis</emphasis>.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">At some point between forty thousand and fifteen thousand years ago, the diversity of human species declined and only <emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis> remained. Two models attempt to explain why. The first and most commonly accepted is the “<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">out of Africa</term>” model. This theory suggests that modern humans emerged first in Africa approximately 200,000 years ago and then, approximately 100,000 years ago, expanded out of Africa and replaced all other human species. The second model is often called the “<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">multiregional evolution model</term>” and proposes that <emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis> evolved from <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis> in several places around the same time. This model emerged as an explanation for the great diversity of modern human traits in different populations around the world. But it relies primarily on the study of fossils and archaeological records rather than on genetic data.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">These theories about human evolution are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and the real answer to the puzzle may be a combination of the two. For example, it’s entirely possible that modern humans or a common ancestor did emerge first in Africa. Then, as this species expanded around the world, it mixed its genetic information with that of other human species. The DNA evidence collected in recent years certainly suggests a more complicated picture, and the debate has not yet been settled. The tools of both archaeology and molecular genetics continue to reveal new insights into the puzzle of human <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">evolution</term> and the rise of <emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis>. And the conclusions we can draw about our distant past will continue to change as we learn more.</para>

    </figure>
    <para id="para-00015">One theory is that modern humans replaced the Neanderthals in Europe through violent competition, including a type of warfare between the two groups. Another model argues that the competition was less about violence and more about resources. This theory posits that modern humans were simply better tool makers, had better survival strategies, and possibly experienced lower mortality rates and higher birth rates. Neanderthals simply couldn’t keep up, and their small population dwindled and then disappeared entirely.</para>
    <para id="para-00016">Modern DNA analysis has opened the door for a new theory, that mating occurred between the two species and that the population of Neanderthals was simply absorbed by modern humans. The presence of small amounts of Neanderthal DNA in modern human populations lends some credibility to this idea, but it seems unlikely to explain the total disappearance of Neanderthals.</para>
    <para id="para-00017">Finally, analysis of climate change in Europe has revealed some variations that could have weakened Neanderthal populations and led to their disappearance in some areas. As of now, no one theory can account for everything. It seems possible that several factors were at play rather than a single primary cause, so the debate goes on.</para>

    <para id="para-00018">Archeological evidence indicates that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014"><emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis></term> began migrating out of eastern and southern Africa as early as 200,000 years ago. This expansion took early humans deeper south, west, and north as far as the Mediterranean Sea. Approximately 100,000 years ago, groups of <emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis> left the African continent and began a global migration that lasted for tens of thousands of years (<link target-id="fig-00004"/>). After crossing the Sinai into southwest Asia, early migrants out of Africa likely followed the coasts of Asia, and by about seventy thousand years ago, they had made their way into India and China.</para>

    <media alt="A map of the world is shown, with Africa shown on the left and North and South America on the right. The bottom third of Africa and most of its east coast are highlighted red, with two arrows coming off of those areas and heading west toward the western coast of Africa. Red indicates “Homo sapiens.” The number “200 000 years ago” is written inside the highlighted red portion in Africa. From the top of the red area in Africa, an arrow travels north into Europe and splits into two, one way heading west toward Portugal (with the number “40 000” alongside it) and splitting off in another branch from there heading east toward Asia (with the number “100 000” alongside it), and the other way heading east all over the world. From this split it heads east towards India (with the number “70 000” alongside it), with a branch heading up toward China. After India, it branches into two directions – one north and one south. The north branch heads up through China and Russia, with one part branching off into western Russia (with the number “25 000” alongside it). It continues north through Russia and crossing over to Alaska (with the number “15 000” alongside it), and south through Canada, with a branch heading southeast in the U.S. (with the number “12 000” alongside it). The original arrow continues south through Mexico and down into South America, where it branches off to the northeast coast.

    </figure>
    <para id="para-00019">Some groups continued moving south through Malaysia, into Indonesia and beyond. In places like Papua New Guinea and Australia, there is evidence of settlements at least forty-five thousand years old. Others groups making their way into southwest Asia from northern Africa entered Europe around forty thousand years ago, moving either along the Mediterranean coast or by way of Turkey into the Danube valley. By twenty-five thousand years ago, <emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis> had reached Siberia and other parts of northern Asia. And approximately fifteen thousand years ago, some groups in Asia crossed into North America, eventually reaching the tip of South America and settling at various locations in between.</para>
    <para id="para-00020">This timeline has been pieced together based on the analysis of several archaeological finds. But our knowledge is still limited, and new discoveries frequently require adjustments to the proposed dates and patterns of global human migration. For example, we now know that because the Earth was in its most recent ice age during this period, areas currently covered by water were then dry land. This is true for large portions of maritime Southeast Asia as well as the Bering Strait between Asia and North America. Humans were able to walk as far south as Java and from Asia into Alaska.</para>
    <para id="para-00021">Yet they also roamed as far as Australia, which was not connected by land to Asia in this period. This means they must have used rafts of some type, probably by crossing short distances between islands. Likewise, discoveries of human habitation dating from fourteen thousand years ago in South America suggest that rafts or boats of some kind may also have been used to skirt the North and South American coasts. No crafts have been or may ever be found, but we must assume they existed.</para>
    <para id="para-00022">More interesting still, analysis of the remains of the eight-thousand-year-old <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Kennewick Man</term> discovered in 1996 in Washington State reveals anatomical features more consistent with Southeast Asian populations than with those traditionally assumed to have populated the Americas. This discovery complicates the version of human migration we think we know, and if anything, it suggests there is much about the process that we may never fully understand.</para>
    <para id="para-00023">But what triggered this migration in the first place? Despite the uncertainties, we can draw some speculative conclusions. We know that around the same time <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016"><emphasis effect="italics">Homo sapiens</emphasis></term> began leaving Africa, the climate there was becoming increasingly dry. Drier conditions meant fewer of the plants and animals humans needed to survive were available. Modern humans were <term id="term-00017">hunter-gatherers</term> like their evolutionary ancestors, meaning they survived by employing the strategies of hunting animals and gathering wild plants rather than by planting crops and raising livestock. As hunter-gathering societies regularly forage over a large area, any scarcity of resources in some places or abundance in others encourages movement. In the lifetime of a single individual, a large-scale migration would have been barely perceptible, if at all. But over tens of thousands of years, human populations traversed an enormous portion of the globe. Nor did they go in a single direction or all at once. Groups likely moved back and forth over areas, responding to the climatic conditions and availability of resources. There were long periods of relative stasis punctuated by movement, creating waves of migration in various directions.</para>
    <para id="para-00024">As humans moved into new environments, they adjusted their strategies to be successful under new conditions. This meant learning to gather different types of plants and hunt different types of animals they came into contact with, including mastodons, woolly mammoths and rhinos, various types of grazing animals, and giant sloths and beavers. The arrival of humans who were highly effective at survival occasionally accompanied major transformations in their new environments. Scientists who study now-extinct animals have recognized for some time that human hunting likely contributed to the decline of a number of these species. Before humans arrived approximately forty-five thousand years ago, for example, Australia was home to a number of large reptiles, a marsupial lion (which carried its young in a pouch), and huge wombats and kangaroos (<link target-id="fig-00005"/>). These species began to vanish around the same time humans reached Australia and well before the climatic warming that led to the extinction of large animals in other places.</para>

    <title>Early Human Technologies</title>
    <para id="para-00025">To understand how early humans lived hundreds of thousands and even millions of years ago, scholars use the tools of archaeology to analyze the objects left behind. Many were made of materials like wood, animal skin, and earth, which rarely endure in the archaeological record. Bone items are somewhat more durable and have occasionally survived. But our window into the distant past is quite small. Stone items are the most likely to have lasted long enough for us to study them today. Beginning possibly as early as 3.3 million years ago, our distant pre-human ancestors began using stone tools for a variety of purposes. This event marks the start of the <term id="term-00018">Paleolithic Age</term> (<emphasis effect="italics">lithos</emphasis> means “stone”), which lasted until nearly twelve thousand years ago.</para>
    <para id="para-00026">The earliest known human-made stone tools date from about 2.6 million years ago. They were likely first created by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019"><emphasis effect="italics">Homo habilis</emphasis></term>, by smashing smooth rocks together to create crudely sharpened edges. The resulting implements are often described as <term id="term-00020">Oldowan tools</term>, and their use continued until about 1.7 million years ago. While a seemingly simple adaptation from our perspective, the development of Oldowan tools in fact represents a huge leap in human engineering ability. These sharpened stones served a variety of cutting, scraping, and chopping purposes. They were highly efficient tools for killing animals, butchering meat, smashing bones to access marrow, and a host of similar tasks.</para>
    <para id="para-00027">Beginning around 1.7 million years ago, some ancient humans began to develop a new and more sophisticated style of stone tool by carefully chipping away smaller flakes of the stone core to create a teardrop-shaped implement often described as a hand-axe. Far thinner and sharper than the Oldowan tools, hand-axes were even better at the cutting, scraping, and chopping tasks for which they were designed. They were such an improvement over earlier tools that archaeologists have given them their own name. They are called <term id="term-00021">Acheulean tools</term> (pronounced <emphasis effect="italics">ah-SHOOL-ee-an</emphasis>), after Saint-Acheul, the site in France where they were first found in the nineteenth century CE. Since then, more Acheulean tools have been uncovered in Africa, the Middle East, and India and scattered in parts of East Asia (<link target-id="fig-00006"/>).</para>

    <para id="para-00028">Far superior to the Oldowan variety, Acheulean tools remained the dominant style of stone tool until as recently as about 250,000 years ago. At that time a new type of utensil emerged in Europe, North Africa, and southwestern Asia. Called <term id="term-00022">Mousterian tools</term>, these implements were smaller hand-axes and tools made from stone flakes rather than cores. In older traditions, the flakes had been removed in order to shape the core as desired, such as into a hand-axe. But in the Mousterian tradition, sometimes the flakes were chipped off in such a way that they themselves could be used as small knives for cutting meat, scraping leather, and serving as spearheads attached to shafts (<link target-id="fig-00007"/>). Advances to the Mousterian techniques later led to other tool traditions. By around forty-five thousand years ago, humans were making a great diversity of specialized tools from stone flakes. These included a variety of scrapers as well as engraving tools for carving and carefully reshaping softer materials like bone and antler into either tools or works of art.</para>

    <para id="para-00029">Another important tool of our human ancestors was <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">fire</term>. When exactly humans began controlling fire remains a topic of debate. There is evidence that earlier ancestors like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024"><emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis></term> used it, but we don’t know whether they were able to start fires or merely used and perpetuated those that naturally occurred. It’s clear, however, that by at least about 125,000 years ago, if not much earlier, modern humans had learned to start and control fires.</para>
    <para id="para-00030">Controlled fires were useful for staying warm in cold climates, scaring off predators, and cooking meat to make it easier to consume and digest. Archaeological finds also suggest that controlled fires aided in the manufacture of certain tools. Wooden spears could be hardened in the flame, making them more effective hunting implements. Some types of stone could be treated with heat to make them easier to chip and mold. Fire also played an important social function. Gathering around the heat and light likely aided in bonding and helped build the social connections vital for cooperative activities and group survival.</para>
    <para id="para-00031">Sitting around a fire may also have been an occasion for early humans to display one of their most powerful tools, the unique ability to use sounds as language. There is some speculation that earlier human ancestors like <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis> were able to make sound and possibly had a type of language. We’ll never know for sure. But we do know that modern humans are capable of making a great variety of different sounds. Biologists calculate that we can produce fifty different phonemes, or distinctive sounds. When strung together in a sophisticated manner, these phonemes can produce many tens of thousands of words to describe what we see, feel, do, and imagine. Beginning at least 100,000 years ago, modern humans began using <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">language</term> in this fashion, gaining a major advantage over competing animals. With language, they could coordinate daily tasks, work much more efficiently in groups, communicate abstract ideas, and pass important information to successive generations. Few tools aided modern humans more than their ability to communicate with complex languages.</para>
    <para id="para-00032">While they left no record of their discussions, early humans did leave a number of impressive artistic depictions. The work that has survived includes small animal and human sculptures, usually made of carved bone or stone. The human-shaped items are often of large, possibly pregnant, women and might have served as symbols of fertility. There are also preserved hand prints, created by placing a hand on stone and blowing pigment around it to preserve the image of its shape.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">Some of the most stunning <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">prehistoric art</term> still in existence today consists of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">cave paintings</term> dating as far back as forty thousand years. Many painted caves have been discovered in Spain and France, but there are also examples in England, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Indonesia. The paintings in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Cave of Altamira</term> in northern Spain are prime examples of this type of art. Within the cave, and dating to about thirty-six thousand years ago, are more than two dozen large images of animals including bison, bulls, horses, deer, and boars. Each is painted in impressive detail using combinations of charcoal and ochre (a pigment made from clay) to produce bold reds, yellows, browns, and blacks. In many instances, the artists incorporated features of the cave walls as part of their designs, giving three-dimensional shape and definition to the animals they drew (<link target-id="fig-00008"/>).</para>

    <media alt="Two pictures are shown. (a) The first picture shows a drawing of a bison on a rocky, cracked, brown wall. The animal’s body is drawn in red with a black underside and tail, black pointy hair in the middle of its back, a black tuft under its mouth and black eyes. The legs are outlined in black and there are black horns on the top of the animal’s head. There are other black and rust colored markings around the animal in various shapes. (b) A picture of a gray, stone wall is shown standing on a tiled floor with sun streaming from windows on the opposite side. The stone wall shows pictures of rust-colored animals all over, with one animal close to the front a light black color. The bumps in the wall make the animals stand out.">

    <title>Interpreting Artistic Expression in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Paleolithic Age</term></title>
    <para id="para-00034">We often think of visual art as a relatively modern gesture consisting of works like oil paintings, sculptures, and even computer-designed images. But artistic expression among our species is quite ancient. We may never know how much art was produced tens of thousands of years ago; many examples have probably been lost. But what we do have is fascinating to behold, though interpreting it is much like trying to reconstruct an entire puzzle from just a few pieces.</para>
    <para id="para-00035">Some of the most interesting and perplexing artistic works include a number of female images sometimes called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Venus figurines</term>. These are relatively small statuettes (one to sixteen inches in height) that were carved from stone, ivory, bone, or clay to resemble women. The tiny <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Venus of Hohle Fels</term>, discovered in Germany, is the oldest such object found to date (<link target-id="fig-00009"/>). Carved from mammoth ivory, it dates to about forty thousand years ago, and what remains of it depicts a woman with large exaggerated breasts. This feature has led some anthropologists to conclude that it was intended to represent sex, reproduction, or fertility.</para>

This female figurine, less than five inches tall, may be as much as thirty-three thousand years old. Like other such images, it shows a woman with exaggerated breasts and a stylized head with no facial features. Analysis of it has produced a number of interpretations, from the traditional representation of fertility to a type of self-portrait.</para>

    <para id="para-00038">Various other female figurines have been found as far from Europe as central Russia, and while individually unique, all have the same characteristics. They are small and were likely intended to be portable. They have exaggerated breasts and often show reproductive organs. They have large bellies that may reflect pregnancy. But without some record from the people who created them, their true symbolism and use will likely remain a mystery.</para>

    <item>Why do you think these figurines are often interpreted as being related to fertility? Do you think that interpretation is plausible? Why or why not?</item>

    </list>
    </note>
    <para id="para-00039">The significance that cave paintings held for the people who created them may never be fully understood. It was once believed the images were designed to be popularly admired as interesting decorations, not unlike the ornaments we put in our homes today. But given that they are often deep in the dark interiors of the caves, where sunlight could not reach, this interpretation has mostly been abandoned.</para>
    <para id="para-00040">With limited insight into the minds of the artists, scholars have concluded that the art likely served some unknown religious purpose. Many speculate that the caves could have been used by shamans—men and women thought to have a special knowledge of the spiritual world—who might have crawled deep into the interior to commune in ceremonies with a type of spiritual force. Such interpretations remain little more than educated guesses. What is indisputable is that the art demonstrates that even tens of thousands of years ago humans had the unique ability to reproduce the world around them in complex, symbolic fashion, through images we can immediately recognize today.</para>
