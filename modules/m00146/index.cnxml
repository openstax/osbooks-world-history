    <para id="para-00002">While the ascension of Mongke Khan in 1251 gave hope for the realization of a Mongol Empire overseeing Eurasian trade, it proved only a temporary rebirth, since a lust for power consumed Chinggis Khan’s grandsons. The rulers of three of the four <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">khanates</term>—the Chagatai Khanate, the Khanate of the Golden Horde, and the Il-Khanate—eventually converted to Islam along with many of their people, but having a common religion did not keep them from fighting one another. By the mid-fourteenth century, two khanates had completely fragmented. Sporadic efforts were made to expand against the Delhi Sultanate but failed. Kublai conquered China and established the Yuan dynasty, also known as the Great Khanate of Yuan China, in the 1270s.

Except in the Slavic areas of the Golden Horde, the lands west of the Volga River, the endorsement of the ruling Mongol elite added to the attractions of Islam, leading the majority of the population to convert.

    <para id="para-00004">By spreading throughout much of western and southern Asia over the centuries since its founding, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Islam</term> had often influenced—and been influenced by—local cultures. This exchange could lead to the formation of unique sects of the faith. One such set of beliefs was <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Sufism</term>, a strain of Islam that emphasized asceticism and meditation as the path to a level of divine understanding that brought a rapturous feeling of love for God. Sufism played an important role in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Islamification</term> of the Mongols and other peoples of the Inner Asian Steppe. While Sufis often sought to live lives of spiritual and moral perfection, their ultimate belief was that God was best worshipped through deep thought and reflection. Living a life strictly adhering to Quranic law was not an end in itself but a means to remove distractions so that the intense contemplation necessary to know God at the level they sought could occur.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">Sufis were instructed in the movement’s practices by spiritual guides and often formed communities. The disruptions of the Mongol conquests caused many of these communities to scatter into the steppe, where they intermingled with people of the Mongol Empire, and where Sufi spiritual guides seemed similar to the shamans Mongols knew as the guardians of worship of Tengri. The Sufi emphasis on a mystical path of meditation and reflection also allowed Mongols to continue to live under the y<emphasis effect="italics">assa</emphasis> and accept Sufi teachings and practices. As Muslims and Mongols interacted and formed families, Sufism made the conversion to Islam seem more of an evolution and less of a dramatic change.</para>

    <title>The Fate of Hulagu’s Il-Khanate</title>
    <para id="para-00006"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Hulagu</term> Khan had to balance several conflicts once civil war broke out after the death of Mongke Khan in 1259. The most serious threat was war with the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Golden Horde</term>, led by Batu’s younger brother Berke. A convert to Islam, Berke had become deeply disturbed by Hulagu’s destruction of Baghdad and the murder of the caliph. There were also disputes about whether Hulagu or the Horde should receive tribute from areas on which Hulagu had reimposed stability. Not surprisingly, Hulagu and Berke ended up on different sides of the civil war to succeed Mongke. Their conflict lasted nearly four years, until both men died in 1265, and their successors moved on to other pursuits.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">For decades, the leaders of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Il-Khanate</term> remained in frequent but intermittent conflict with the Golden Horde and the Mamluks of Egypt, who were sometimes joined by the Seljuks operating out of Anatolia and the Chagatai khans. Repulsing these attacks consumed most of the Il-Khanate’s efforts and resources, a situation compounded by periodic bouts of civil war over succession and making further expansion out of the question. The Il-Khans constantly struggled to hold the Tigris-Euphrates basin, leaving the Nile delta and lands holy to the Abrahamic religions in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Levant</term> forever beyond their grasp.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">Most of the population of the Il-Khanate had become Muslim centuries before. The need to concentrate on defense led the Il-Khans to leave most of the work of government in the hands of the religious scholars called the <emphasis effect="italics">ulama</emphasis>, reinforcing traditional Islamic law and custom. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Ghazan</term> Khan, who ruled from 1295 to 1304, firmly favored Islam. His brother Oljaitu (who took the Muslim name Khodabandeh) promoted Shia Islam, further entrenching its presence in what is today eastern Iraq and Iran. Despite this, conflict with its Muslim neighbors continued as the Il-Khanate sought to take more resources for itself at their expense.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">Overall, the economy was slow to recover from the devastation of Hulagu’s attack, especially with frequent warfare continuing to destroy the irrigation and urban infrastructure. There were chronic labor shortages in the first generations after Hulagu’s conquest because of wide-scale murder, enslavement, and relocation, as well as substantial emigration to neighboring Islamic lands. Ghazan’s reign laid the groundwork for a generation of prosperity and cultural flowering relative to the tumultuous periods before and after. This prosperity was centered east of Baghdad and the Tigris-Euphrates basin, around Maragha and Tabriz in modern Iran. The Il-Khanate rulers tried to live up to Chinggis and Ogedei Khan’s dream of a world united in trade by negotiating trade deals, most famously with Venice and Genoa on the Italian Peninsula. They were also able to maintain secure trade with Mongolian China. This prosperity, however, was not enough to overcome the peril of succession struggles. After the son of Ghazan died without an heir in 1335, the Il-Khanate fell into a civil war from which it never emerged. While several men claimed to be <emphasis effect="italics">il-khan</emphasis> in subsequent years, none exercised control over more than a fraction of the lands Hulagu had conquered.</para>

The second, from Montesquieu’s <emphasis effect="italics">Spirit of the Laws</emphasis>, was written in 1748 as a work of social science aimed at Enlightenment intellectuals. Montesquieu’s disdain for absolute authority undoubtedly influenced his view of the great khan.</para>

    <title>The Golden Horde</title>
    <para id="para-00017">The areas the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Golden Horde</term> ruled, northwest Asia and the lands of the Rus, were less economically developed. People had a greater diversity of lifestyles and less centralized authority than imposed by the Il-Khans, and they were able to avoid splintering into civil war until outside factors intervened more than a generation after the Il-Khanate fell.</para>
    <para id="para-00018"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Batu</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Berke</term>, the foundational leaders of the Horde, established a capital for the storage of tribute as their grandfather had done, but they mainly roamed with their armies, raiding neighbors or defending against attacks. The people conquered by the Golden Horde varied from Turkish peoples like the Kipchaks, seminomads similar to the Mongols, to settled Slavic peasants in small urban centers. The Mongols ruled over the Turks indirectly, allowing local leaders to enforce the <emphasis effect="italics">yassa</emphasis>, collect taxes, and conscript labor and soldiers. Mongol officials in the capital received and distributed tribute and heard appeals of local decisions. The Rus and other Slavic peoples were ruled more directly, with Mongol overseers assigned to each local ruler to make sure taxes flowed in and rebellion was kept down.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">While Berke was the first Mongol ruler and khan of the Golden Horde to embrace <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Islam</term>, not all his successors were Muslim. Islam continued to gain adherents among the Horde’s Mongols, however. In 1313, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Uzbeg</term> made Islam the official religion of the Golden Horde, but he did not remove the <emphasis effect="italics">yassa’s</emphasis> tax exemption for other religions. Uzbeg’s promotion of Islam undoubtedly strengthened the Islamic community throughout the Golden Horde’s lands.</para>
    <para id="para-00020">At the same time, the Horde’s rule strengthened the Orthodox Christian church in its Slavic regions. The church came to represent <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">Rus</term> national identity as people turned to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Christianity</term> to distinguish themselves from, and perhaps subversively resist, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Mongols</term>. The tax and service exemptions the <emphasis effect="italics">yassa</emphasis> gave religious institutions and those running them surpassed those the church received from Rus nobles. Church-owned land expanded under the Horde, whether because of donations to help the church provide increasing amounts of spiritual solace and identity, or because of fraud that enabled elites to live free of Mongol taxation and obligation by donating their land and then becoming the church officials in charge of the donation. By the collapse of Mongol rule in the late fifteenth century, the Russian Orthodox church’s holdings had grown to about one-third of the arable land in the areas formerly ruled by Rus nobles.</para>
    <para id="para-00021">The Golden Horde both benefited from and contributed to the prosperity brought about by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Pax Mongolica</term>. Direct European trade was under their control. Whether an import to the Mongol world in the east was produced by the Rus or brought from the continent by Italian merchants, it almost certainly entered through the Golden Horde, which had the first opportunity to buy it. The <emphasis effect="italics">yam</emphasis> that facilitated the movement of goods throughout the empire was maintained for hundreds of years after Mongol rule had dissipated.</para>
    <para id="para-00022">The troubled Chagatai Khanate lay in the middle of Mongol lands. Conflict with the other Mongol Khanates and Kublai’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Yuan</term> dynasty was inevitable. At various times, separately or in combination with each other, the other Mongol states supported usurpers against the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Chagatai</term> Khans. While most had no long-term success, they kept the khanate in turmoil until it splintered into small states in the mid-fourteenth century. In addition to fighting other Mongols, some Chagatai Khans raided and on a couple of occasions tried to conquer the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">Delhi Sultanate</term>. These efforts proved futile and weakened the regime, inviting more challenges and instability.</para>
    <para id="para-00023">The most important long-term impact of the Chagatai Khanate was its solidification of Islam’s hold over western central Asia. Central Asia had always been a place of religious diversity, given that merchants of different faiths traversed its trade routes. It was a major factor in spreading <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Buddhism</term> from India and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">Islam</term> beyond the borders of the caliphate. Asian versions of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">Christianity</term>, different from the Catholic and Orthodox traditions in Europe, thrived there as well. The last ruler to have governed the unified Chagatai Khanate, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">Tarmashirin</term>, instituted policies that favored the displacement of other faiths by Islam and replaced the <emphasis effect="italics">yassa</emphasis> with the more restrictive <term id="term-00037">sharia</term>, or Islamic religious law. While this change provoked resentment among the non-Muslim populations, Islamic law continued to be in force in lands given to the Chagatai after that khanate collapsed into small states that were in constant conflict.</para>

    <title>Yuan China</title>
    <para id="para-00024">In <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">Yuan</term> China, even as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">Kublai</term> Khan was lining up forces against Ariq Boke, he demanded the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">Song</term> emperor recognize him as the Son of Heaven in exchange for autonomy over the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">Han</term> Chinese people. Not unexpectedly, the Song Son of Heaven declined to submit to vassalage under a man he considered a barbarian, and war broke out. Eventually, Kublai’s forces were victorious, prompting him to declare that the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">Mandate of Heaven</term> had shifted to him, and the Yuan dynasty was proclaimed. As might be expected for the champion of Mongols adapting to a settled lifestyle, Kublai set up a capital city close to the old Jin capital of Zhongdu, both part of modern Beijing. China proved very difficult to govern, however; by the 1330s, the Yuan dynasty was in decline.</para>
    <section id="sect-00006">
    <title>The Conquest of Song China</title>
    <para id="para-00025">Although Kublai attempted to subdue the Song while fighting Ariq Boke, he did not begin serious efforts to conquer them until 1265. It took over a dozen years, but by 1279, the Song military was broken and its royal family dead or in hiding.</para>
    <para id="para-00026">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">Mongols</term>, with allied peoples from north China and other parts of the steppe, dominated the Song on land. The Song military never developed good cavalry, perhaps hoping their fiery and explosive weapons would intimidate enemy horses and render their opponent’s cavalry useless. Retreating to the cities was not an option, because the Mongols were extremely adept at siege warfare. One area in which the Mongols were almost completely inexperienced, however, was naval warfare. The long and expansive river systems in southern China posed serious obstacles to the Mongols’ ability to completely conquer the Song.</para>
    <para id="para-00027">Through the 1270s, the Song still tried to function as a working, mobile government, moving up and down river systems until finally pushed out to sea, whereupon they moved from port to port with a huge fleet of ships. A combination of the geography of the region, previous developments in hydraulic and irrigation technology, and Song seafaring skills allowed them to resist the arrival of the Mongols for many years. Tens of thousands of civilians loyal to the Song traveled with them. In a great irony of history, the increasingly settled Yuan Mongols had turned the Song into aquatic seminomads. The Mongols adapted to naval warfare by relying on loyal non-Mongol experts. They controlled the labor of skilled craftspeople who built warships and had sailors who could maneuver them.</para>
    <para id="para-00028">In the year 1279, many Song loyalists, approximately 250,000 people in over a thousand ocean-capable boats, anchored off a remote bay near modern Yamen, China. There they began building a capital and prepared for a last stand, hoping that if they won, their victory would rally the Chinese to revolt against the Mongols. Mongol forces secured the land behind the Song ships, leaving them dependent on only the supplies they had on board. Within a few days, the Songs’ supply of fresh water ran out. Weakened by dehydration, they were no match for the Mongols. As a few ships fell to Mongol boarding parties, morale among the Song collapsed, and most of them committed suicide by jumping into the sea. China was united again for the first time in more than three hundred years, not by a Han Chinese Son of Heaven, but by the Mongol Kublai Khan.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00007">
    <title>Politics, Economy, and Society in Yuan China</title>
    <para id="para-00029">Although retaining some Song policies such as the rotation of officeholders, the Yuan dynasty operated very differently from the way earlier Chinese dynasties had done. Kublai Khan’s most drastic change was to replace the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">Confucian</term> system of class distinctions based on economic function with one based on ethnicity. At the top of the Yuan class structure were <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">Mongols</term>, followed by non-Chinese people, who were Europeans or previous steppe inhabitants like the Jurchen, Tangut, and Khitan. The bottom two classes were Chinese people: those of Han ethnicity who had been ruled by the Jin in the north, and the remaining Song Chinese who lived in the south. Mongols could not marry people from these bottom two classes. Everyone’s place in this new class system was noted in census records for each family, along with each head of household’s occupation, which was sometimes assigned if a shortage of certain types of labor occurred.</para>
    <para id="para-00030">Adopting the Khitan idea of ruling different types of people differently, the Yuan dynasty had separate types of administration for its varied peoples. Even though an increasing number of Mongols were literate, including Kublai who was the first Mongol great khan to read, the mandarin written exam system fell into disuse. Mongols were subject to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046"><emphasis effect="italics">yassa</emphasis></term>, as were the next two classes, who were ruled over by administrators appointed by the chief local Mongol administrator or the emperor himself. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">Song</term> Chinese, who were at the bottom of the four-class system, were governed by two administrators, one a Chinese person and one a Mongol or non-Chinese person. Both were imperial appointees. The Chinese administrator was under the supervision of and responsible to his counterpart. People in all these positions were rotated periodically, so they could not build up a power base.</para>
    <para id="para-00031">Some non-Chinese administrators over the Song had not intended to work in the Yuan government. They came seeking some favor, often the right to trade, in exchange for which the emperors required them to perform administrative tasks. Literate Europeans came to know of the riches of Yuan China through one of these bureaucrats, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">Marco Polo</term>, a young merchant, and member of a Venetian trade caravan who, along with several of his family members, ended up spending almost twenty-five years in Mongol lands and who wrote a popular account of the merchants’ experiences. While the Polos were the most famous of these hostage bureaucrats, serving for about twenty years, most were Muslim traders from other parts of the Mongol Empire. Regardless of how well they did their jobs, such bureaucrats were not likely to bond with the population and create a power base from which to challenge imperial authority.</para>
    <para id="para-00032">Following Kublai’s death in 1294, his system’s flaws became apparent. In 1315, his great-grandson <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">Buyantu</term> reinstated the mandarin exam system, which now reflected the dual nature of the administration. Non-Chinese people took different (and shorter) exams than the Chinese people, and between 25 and 50 percent of those who passed had to be non-Chinese people. The effect of this quota was magnified because <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">Song</term> Chinese people made up more than 90 percent of the population, according to Yuan censuses. Between the differences in the exams and the quota system, it was much easier for Mongols and non-Chinese to pass than for Chinese.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">Although travelers like Marco Polo, and to a lesser degree the North African Muslim traveler Ibn <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">Battuta</term>, wrote of the impressive wealth of Yuan China, economic growth had at best stagnated, thanks to a decline in consumer purchasing power caused by inflation and heavy taxation. The use of paper currency was a major contributor to inflation. While paper money was theoretically convertible to metal or silk, the Yuan government issued much more of it than it had metal or silk to redeem it with. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">Kublai</term> decreed that currency must be used in transactions with the government, thus ensuring that paper money featured in at least some economic activity. This meant the population could not escape increasing inflation, however, as successive Yuan governments issued more paper currency to pay their bills and forced the population to obtain such money to pay their taxes. As more paper money entered the system without objects of value to back it up, ever more of it was required to purchase the same amount of goods and labor.</para>

    </note>
    <para id="para-00035">The increasing taxes that partly resulted from inflation were pumped back into the economy through narrow and unproductive sectors, draining wealth from the rest of the economy. The Yuan spent lavishly on grandiose but failed military ventures that bankrupted the government. These were mainly Kublai’s projects. Kublai twice tried to conquer what is now Vietnam, and in even more costly ventures, he attempted complex sea invasions, two of Japan and one of Java. There were also periods of chaos and instability because of succession struggles. After Kublai’s appointed successor and grandson died in 1307, seven emperors reigned over the next twenty-six years. Resentment, especially among the Song population, seethed beneath the surface as government extraction of resources increased and inflation eroded the standard of living. As if all that was not challenge enough for the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">Yuan</term>, in 1331 people outside the capital in the Hebei area began to sicken and die in large numbers. Within three years, 90 percent of that area’s population was dead from a strange new illness, later known as the Black Death. The Mongol Yuan government, like many of its people, did not survive long.</para>

    <title>Section Summary</title>
    <para id="para-00036">While Kublai’s Yuan dynasty reunited China and gave it the same ruler as the Mongol homeland and much of central Asia, it revived neither the prosperity of China nor the robustness of the steppe people. Trade continued to flow, and the effects of earlier economic growth were still apparent, but less wealth was subsequently produced. This meant less went to the steppe, and those producing wealth saw increasingly fewer returns on their labor.
